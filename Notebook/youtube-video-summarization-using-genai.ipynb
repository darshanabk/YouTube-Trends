I'm sure you have all heard of ChatGPT by now. It has become a buzzword within days of its release and professionals in all fields, especially in high skilled areas like lawyers, doctors, engineers are questioning whether such AI can actually replace them and work. So in this video I want to talk about what Chat GPT is and how it even popped up, talk a bit about the organization behind GPT called \"OpenAI\", which has already created many other machine learning models besides Chat GPT and...\n","\n","üß† Generating summary...\n","Trying Gemini model: models/gemini-1.5-pro\n","\n","‚úÖ Summary:\n"]},{"data":{"text/markdown":["This video discusses the impact of ChatGPT on engineering, particularly DevOps.  The presenter explores what ChatGPT is, its origins in OpenAI, and its technical underpinnings.  The video then dives into a live demo, using ChatGPT for several DevOps tasks:\n","\n","* **Docker:** Generating Dockerfiles for a Node.js application, optimizing them with .dockerignore files, and implementing multi-stage builds.  The presenter highlights ChatGPT's ability to explain its output and incorporate feedback for iterative improvements.\n","* **Kubernetes:** Creating deployment and service manifests, adding resource quotas, and implementing production-ready and security best practices.  The presenter notes that while ChatGPT provides good boilerplate code, some knowledge is needed to validate its output.\n","* **Jenkins:** Generating a Jenkinsfile for a CI/CD pipeline, including building, testing, Docker image creation, and deployment to Kubernetes.  The presenter finds this task more challenging for ChatGPT, requiring significant manual adjustments and highlighting the need for existing CI/CD knowledge.  The video also briefly touches on converting the Jenkinsfile to a GitLab CI configuration, with relatively positive results.\n","\n","Beyond the demo, the video discusses an open-source CLI tool called aiac, built on top of ChatGPT for generating infrastructure-as-code templates. The presenter demonstrates its usage for creating Dockerfiles and Terraform scripts, emphasizing its concise output and ability to retry generations.\n","\n","Finally, the video addresses the question of whether ChatGPT will replace engineers. The presenter argues that while AI can automate certain tasks, engineers will become more productive by leveraging these tools.  The focus should shift towards higher-level thinking, problem-solving, and \"prompt engineering\" to effectively utilize AI. The presenter concludes that engineering jobs are not threatened but rather evolving, emphasizing the importance of continuous learning and adaptation.  He encourages viewers to share their own experiences with AI in the comments.\n"],"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"}],"source":["# Run the script\n","if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n","    main()\n","    #https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-kE11fhfaQ\n","    # https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH5EY7FCFQw\n","    #['XvtFppcynYM','mg1ZqahIpVw','xH5EY7FCFQw','an8SrFtJBdM','Qm79wDSCZ-w','vPd7H8EMmD0']"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"22af03c1","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"f36a324e-ba7d-436f-b007-518e7bd6f7ea","_uuid":"af91b99e-22c5-4a49-95de-bec6a8bdf0a5","collapsed":false,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"papermill":{"duration":0.005551,"end_time":"2025-04-21T14:34:24.074483","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-04-21T14:34:24.068932","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[{"sourceId":97258,"sourceType":"competition"}],"dockerImageVersionId":31013,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.11"},"papermill":{"default_parameters":{},"duration":33.397771,"end_time":"2025-04-21T14:34:26.951788","environment_variables":{},"exception":null,"input_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","output_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","parameters":{},"start_time":"2025-04-21T14:33:53.554017","version":"2.6.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
