## [Check out DevOps YouTube Trends](https://devops-youtube-trends.streamlit.app/)
## **Overview**
This project is an ongoing initiative aimed at developing an automated pipeline to extract and process video data from YouTube based on specific keywords. Leveraging the YouTube Data API, the pipeline retrieves the most-viewed videos matching the criteria and systematically stores the data in a GitHub repository. The goal is to automate data retrieval, analysis, and storage, enabling actionable insights.


## Project Scope
- **Detailed Project Scope**:
  - [View Scope](https://github.com/darshanabk/YouTubeFoodChannelAnalysis/blob/main/ProjectScope.md)
 
## **Workflow**
  - **Source**: Kaggle -> Google Cloud Console (YouTube Data API v3) -> Data Extraction -> GitHub Automation
      
  - **Data Cleaning**: Kaggle -> Fetch Source File from GitHub -> Data Cleaning -> GitHub Automation
  
  - **Requirement**: Kaggle -> Fetch ISO Code from Rest API -> Process -> GitHub Automation
  
  - **Feature Engineering**: Kaggle Fetch Data Cleaning and Requirement Files -> Process -> GitHub Automation
  
  - **Streamlit**: Streamlit Cloud -> Fetch Processed File from GitHub -> Process and Visualize on Streamlit -> Deployed App

Every process fetches the most recent file to ensure up-to-date data. The process runs daily for real-time data.

## **Source**
#### Code Implementation
- **Data Extraction Script**:
  - [View Script](https://github.com/darshanabk/YouTubeFoodChannelAnalysis/blob/main/sourcedaily.ipynb)
  - This script implements the logic for extracting and processing YouTube video data.
#### Extracted Data
- **Raw Data Repository**:
  - [View Data](https://github.com/darshanabk/YouTubeFoodChannelAnalysis/tree/main/Source/Daily)
  - This directory contains JSON files storing raw extracted data, which are updated daily.

<!-- ### 1. Features:
   - **YouTube Data Extraction**:
      - Fetch top videos based on keywords using the YouTube Data API.
      - Extract details like video title, channel name, view count, likes, comments, and tags.
   
   - **Data Storage**:
      - Save extracted data into JSON files with timestamps for record-keeping.
   
   - **GitHub Integration**:
      - Automatically push the extracted JSON files to a GitHub repository.
      - Maintain a structured directory system in the repository for organized data storage.
   
   - **Error Handling**:
      - Ensures smooth operation by handling API and GitHub errors.
   
   - **Tools and Technologies**:
      - **YouTube Data API**: Fetch video details.
      - **Python Libraries**:
        - `pandas`: For data processing.
        - `re` and `datetime`: For string and date manipulations.
        - `shutil` and `os`: For file and directory operations.
        - `git` and `Repo`: For executing Git commands.
        - `pytz` and `timedelta`: For handling time zones and time differences.
        - `IPython.display`: For displaying JSON responses in Jupyter Notebooks.
      - **Kaggle Secrets**: Manage sensitive API keys and repository credentials securely.
      - **GitHub**: Store and manage extracted data.
###  2. Additional Libraries:
