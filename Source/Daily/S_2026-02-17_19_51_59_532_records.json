        "videoDescription":"Differences and Overlaps of Cloud and DevOps Engineer Roles as well as deep dive of Cloud Engineer Tasks and Responsibilities\n\nDevOps engineer and Cloud engineer are 2 popular roles in software engineering. But there is a lot of mix up of these two roles and many people and many companies often use them interchangeably. They mix the tasks and responsibilities of these two very often. For example there are plenty of job descriptions for \"DevOps Cloud Engineer\" or \"Cloud DevOps Engineer\", which would naturally make you think that they are the same role, but then why would you have two names for the same role?

But there is a lot of mix up of these two roles and many people and many companies often use them interchangeably. They mix the tasks and responsibilities of these two very often. For example there are plenty of job descriptions for \"DevOps Cloud Engineer\" or \"Cloud DevOps Engineer\", which would naturally make you think that they are the same role, but then why would you have two names for the same role?

There is a lot of discussion going on, where some people are asking whether platform engineering replaces DevOps. Many people say it goes hand in hand and is rather an addition to DevOps, but in reality it's a bit more complicated than that. Platform engineering actually changes a lot of established rules we knew about DevOps, SRE and Cloud engineering, it changes the game and introduces some new rules.\n\nSo let's clearly define, what platform engineering exactly is, more interestingly, why was there even a need for this new role and how it evolved and of course how it compares to DevOps and Cloud engineering and does it really replace any of these roles?\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac T I M E S T A M P S \u23f0  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n0:00 - Intro and Overview\n0:50 - Why Platform Engineering?

We all know that schools and universities don't necessarily prepare us for the corporate world. There's a huge difference between what's going on in the industry and what's being taught to us in schools and colleges.\n\nWe are here to prepare you for the world with content based on my industry knowledge & experiences as a developer.",

        "videoDescription":"Are you looking for the best DevOps certifications in 2023? If so, you've come to the right place! In this video, we're sharing the top 5 DevOps certifications that are likely to be in high demand in 2023.\nDevOps certifications are one of the best ways to show hiring managers that you're qualified for a technical position. They're also a great way to set yourself up for more advanced career opportunities.\n\n\n\nIn this video we will cover the following topics:\n\n00:00 -  Introduction\n01:42 - Why Certifications are Important\n03:35 - Python Certification\n05:30 - Docker\n06:15 - Kubernetes\n08:22 - Terraform\n08:57 - Linux\n10:16 - Conclusion\n\nWant to view a clear path to becoming a DevOps Engineer? Visit our website - www.kodekloud.com\nWe have various Learning Paths to help you choose your next step and shape your DevOps Career. \n\nCheck out our learning paths at KodeKloud to get started:\n\n -Linux: https:\/\/bit.ly\/LinuxLearningPath\n- DevOps Learning Path: https:\/\/bit.ly\/DevOpsLearningPath-YT\n -Docker: https:\/\/bit.ly\/DockerLearningPath\n -Kubernetes: https:\/\/bit.ly\/KubernetesLearningPath\n -Infrastructure as Code(IAC): https:\/\/bit.ly\/IACLearningPath\n -Programming: https:\/\/bit.ly\/ProgrammingLearningPath\n\n \nThose new to the Programming and DevOps world often find it challenging to start their journey due to the missing basic prerequisites. For example, issues with setting up a basic lab environment using VirtualBox, problems with networking, or trouble with working with the Linux CLI or text editors like vi editor. Sometimes there are issues with applications - like getting a sample application to work, problems with getting the dependencies to install correctly or trouble with getting a web server to communicate with a database server. Or, at other times, it's working with data formats like JSON or YAML.\n\nSo we have identified a gap, and we believe that this is due to missing some of the basic prerequisites, such as knowing the basics of Linux, the basics of tools like VirtualBox, or knowing the basics of the most commonly used applications like Java, Python or NodeJS or web servers like Apache, NGINX etc. As a DevOps or Cloud Engineer, it is crucial to have these basics cleared. And that\u2019s why we are helping you to bridge that gap!\n\nFor more updates on courses and tips, follow us on:\n-Website: https:\/\/kodekloud.com\/\n-LinkedIn: https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/kode...\n-Twitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/kodekloud1\n-Facebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/kodekloudtra...\n-Instagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/kodekloud\/\n-Blog: https:\/\/kodekloud.com\/blog\/\n\n#itcertifications  #devopscertification #kodekloud",

Request only private parallel jobs unless you have a valid reason for public jobs.\n\nApproval Timeframe: It typically takes 24 to 48 hours for Microsoft to approve parallel job requests.\n\nVerification: After approval, you can verify the availability of parallel jobs in the Azure DevOps portal under the \"Parallel Jobs\" section in the billing settings.\n\nBilling Setup for Additional Jobs: For additional parallel jobs, users need an active Azure subscription (e.g., Pay-As-You-Go), and setup billing, linking it to the Azure subscription. This will allow for purchasing more parallel jobs if needed.\n\n\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83c\udfeb This complete tutorial is compiled by Sandeep Soni, a Microsoft Certified Trainer, a Software & Corporate Trainer for 27years!  \nFor more Training Courses Visit: https:\/\/www.bestitcourses.com\n\n\ud83d\udcf2 \ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf0\ud835\ude01 \ud835\ude04\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf5 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff\ud83d\udc4b \nCall Sandeep Soni for Career Guidance \u25ba +91 98490 01840 \nConnect with me on LINKEDIN \u25ba https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/sandeepsoni123\/ \n \n\ud83d\udc4d \ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb'\ud835\ude01 \ud835\uddd9\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf4\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude01 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddfc \n- Like the video if you found it helpful. \n- Subscribe to our channel for more DevOps tutorials and certification guides. \n- Hit the bell icon to get notified of our latest videos. \n\n\ud83d\udcac Join the Conversation \nHave questions or need further clarification?

It\u2019s huge right now in the tech community, and it\u2019s definitely becoming more central to how teams build software.\nIf you\u2019re starting with DevOps, this video will help you understand the basics and give you a good head-start on your journey. You will also learn about the different stages in DevOps, what tools are needed at each stage, and how potential problems should be handled.\n\nStart your DevOps Career (Beginners - Advanced) - https:\/\/bit.ly\/DevOpsLearningPath-YT\n\nIn this video we will cover the following topics:\n\n00:00 -  Introduction\n00:27 - Problems before DevOps\n01:33 - Two Stages of DevOps\n02:12 - Real World Scenario 1\n03:28 - Real World Scenario 2\n04:12 - Automation\n05:06 - Benefits of DevOps\n06:10 - Summary\n07:22 - Conclusion\n \nThose new to the Programming and DevOps world often find it challenging to start their journey due to the missing basic prerequisites. For example, issues with setting up a basic lab environment using VirtualBox, problems with networking, or trouble with working with the Linux CLI or text editors like vi editor. Sometimes there are issues with applications - like getting a sample application to work, problems with getting the dependencies to install correctly or trouble with getting a web server to communicate with a database server. Or, at other times, it's working with data formats like JSON or YAML.\n\nSo we have identified a gap, and we believe that this is due to missing some of the basic prerequisites, such as knowing the basics of Linux, the basics of tools like VirtualBox, or knowing the basics of the most commonly used applications like Java, Python or NodeJS or web servers like Apache, NGINX etc. As a DevOps or Cloud Engineer, it is crucial to have these basics cleared. And that\u2019s why we are helping you to bridge that gap!\n\nWant to view a clear path to becoming a DevOps Engineer?

You\u2019ll get a clear, practical explanation of DevOps, MLOps, AIOps, and DataOps, how AI agents fit across all of these domains, and how to think about your career without chasing hype or fear-driven narratives.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll learn in this video:\n\nWhy DevOps is not dying, but evolving into specialized domains\n\nThe real difference between DevOps, MLOps, AIOps, and DataOps\n\nWhere AI agents and agentic workflows actually fit in operations\n\nWhen it makes sense to stay in DevOps\n\nWhen transitioning to MLOps, AIOps, or DataOps is the right move\n\nWhy these paths are not mutually exclusive\n\nHow to choose a direction based on the problems that genuinely excite you\n\nThis video is designed for engineers who want clarity, not clickbait \u2014 and who want to make career decisions grounded in real systems, real demand, and real interest.\n\nIf this helped you understand where the industry is heading, consider subscribing. In upcoming videos, I\u2019ll go deeper into each specialization \u2014 DevOps, MLOps, AIOps, and DataOps \u2014 with real-world context and practical insights.\n\n#DevOps #MLOps #AIOps #DataOps #DevOpsCareer #AIAgents #AgenticWorkflows #CloudEngineering #FutureOfDevOps",

        "videoDescription":"Today we're working with Azure Pipelines and exploring the different options you have when working with agent pools. The main focus will be on the new Azure Managed DevOps Agent Pools, what they are, how they work, and why you might want to use them.\n\nWe\u2019ll start by deploying some prerequisites using Terraform, including a virtual network to host our agents. You\u2019ll see how to use the AzAPI provider to get the job done and I\u2019ll walk you through it all, step by step, as we build this Terraform project from scratch.\n\nOnce everything is up and running, we\u2019ll connect our agent to an Azure Pipeline and run a deployment to test it out.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to automate Azure DevOps agent pool provisioning with Terraform and AzAPI, or just want to learn more about CI\/CD in Azure, you\u2019re in the right place. Hope you enjoy the video!\n\nTimestamps: \n0:00 Intro\n1:00 Differences between managed devops pools and other offerings\n3:40 Comparison table between VMSS and Managed Devops Pool\n5:40 Writing our Terraform code\n27:50 Writing Terraform for our Managed Devops pool\n33:30 Deploying our code\n34:10 Create pipelines and test our pool\n38:20 Recap and outro\n\nLinks to learn documentation: \nhttps:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/devops\/pipelines\/agents\/agents?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml%2Cbrowser\nhttps:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/devops\/managed-devops-pools\/migrate-from-scale-set-agents?view=azure-devops\n\n\u2615\ufe0f Want to buy me a coffee? https:\/\/ko-fi.com\/lindbergtech\nOnly if you want to, of course\n\n\nSocials:\nLinkedIn:  https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/carl-lindberg-a7b76a175\/\nGithub: https:\/\/github.com\/carlzxc71\n\n#terraform #azure #microsoft #cloud #iac",

OPA provides a high-level declarative language that lets us specify policies as code and simple APIs to offload policy decision-making from our software. We can use OPA to enforce policies in microservices, Kubernetes, CI\/CD pipelines, API gateways, and more. \nIn kubernetes, OPA uses admission controllers.\n\nWhat is OPA Gatekeeper?\n\nOPA Gatekeeper is a specialized project providing first-class integration between OPA and Kubernetes.\nOPA Gatekeeper adds the following on top of plain OPA:\n\u25cf An extensible, parameterized policy library.\n\u25cf Native Kubernetes CRDs for instantiating the policy library (aka \u201cconstraints\u201d).\n\u25cf Native Kubernetes CRDs for extending the policy library (aka \u201cconstraint templates\u201d).\n\u25cf Audit functionality.\n\nWhy you need Gatekeeper?\n\nAs a Platform DevOps engineer managing multiple Kubernetes clusters for various projects, you face challenges when users deploy applications without adhering to best practices. Key issues include:\n  1.     Lack of ownership unless users apply labels themselves.\n  2.     No resource limits, leading to high costs.\n  3.     Untrusted images impacting other applications.\n  4.     Security and best practice violations across clusters.\n\nTo address these, we need governance to enforce limits and rules via policies. OPA Gatekeeper can be configured to implement these policies, ensuring best practices are followed.\n\nFollow my mentors too : @PavanElthepu    @MPrashant   @GouravSharma   @cloudwithraj   @AntonPutra   @AbhishekVeeramalla   @kubesimplify   @kshindi   @DevOpsJourney \n\nTags : #prometheus   #secrets #docker  #k8s #kubernetes #cncf #rbac #serverless #grafana #autoscaling #deployment  #opensource #devops #grafana #vault #terraform #kustomize #etcd #controlplane #container #opa #dockerhub #gatekeeper",

It's distributed so people around the world can share code\n2. It does version control\n\nSo, with version control, you can take snapshots of the state of your current code and maintain a history.\n\nBranching is really the third thing. Git branches allow developers to do isolated development and take chances without messing up the main branch.\n\nSo when someone asks me 'What is Git?', that is how I typically respond.",

Their job includes coming up with innovative recipes, testing them, and adding the successful ones to the menu. At the same time, they also prepare food to meet the regular demand of customers who visit the restaurant daily. This dual responsibility of innovation and ongoing service can become overwhelming, especially during busy hours when the kitchen is already at full capacity.\n\nWait staff, on the other hand, focus on delivering the prepared food to customers. Their primary role is to ensure that the food reaches the diners promptly and in perfect condition, keeping the restaurant\u2019s operations running smoothly.\n\nExperimenting with a new dish during peak hours, however, becomes a significant challenge. The process of testing new recipes while maintaining the flow of regular orders often leads to disruptions in the kitchen, causing delays and dissatisfaction among customers.\n\nTo address this, the restaurant hires a kitchen manager. The kitchen manager creates a separate small kitchen dedicated to experimenting with new dishes. This ensures that the chefs can focus on their innovations without interfering with the ongoing operations. Once a dish is perfected, the kitchen manager introduces automation, such as using a conveyor belt, to streamline the cooking process. This allows the new dish to be produced efficiently alongside the existing menu items while ensuring there are no interruptions in serving food to the restaurant's customers.\n\nYes, DevOps engineers are none other than automation experts.\n\n#devops #devopsengineer #careerguidance  #newvlog  #trendingreels \n\nroles and responsibilities devops engineer\ndoes devops engineer need coding\nwhat is devops for beginners\nroles of a devops engineer\njob description of devops engineer\nrequirements for devops engineer\nskills required for devops engineer\ndefinition of devops engineer\n@Ajayhr_01",

Platform Engineering focusses on the building the infrastructure and the systems that are needed for running your applications and supporting your application throughout the software life cycle. So,  the goal  is to support the developers in the organisation and treat them as customers. That\u2019s why we have in platform engineering the concept of IDP Internal developer platform.\n \nSo, this platform is treated as an actual product and the customers of the product are the developers.\nWhat is the role of the IDP?\nIt is to create a thin layer on top of the toolchain that is used inside the organisation to standardise the processes and help developers to have one way to deploy into production\n\nWHO AM I:\nHey friends, welcome to my YouTube channel  @outofdevops  .

What Is RabbitMQ?\n\nRabbitMQ is an open-source message broker \u2014 it acts as a middleman between different parts of a system that need to communicate asynchronously.\nIt uses the AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) as its core protocol.\n\nIn simpler terms:\n\nIt receives messages from producers (applications sending data),\n\nStores them temporarily in queues,\n\nAnd delivers them to consumers (applications receiving data).\n\nThis helps decouple systems \u2014 the sender and receiver don\u2019t need to be active at the same time.\n\n\u2699\ufe0f 2. Why Use RabbitMQ?\n\n\u2705 Decoupling \u2013 Producers don\u2019t need to know who consumes messages.\n\u2705 Asynchronous communication \u2013 Improves system responsiveness.\n\u2705 Load balancing \u2013 Messages can be distributed across multiple consumers.\n\u2705 Reliability \u2013 Ensures message delivery even if parts of the system fail.\n\u2705 Scalability \u2013 You can add more queues or consumers easily.\n\u2705 Flexible routing \u2013 Decide how messages flow using exchanges and routing keys.\n\n\ud83d\udd29 3.

Most people think it's about learning Kubernetes, mastering CI\/CD pipelines, and deploying the right tools, so they focus on technical skills while missing what truly matters.\n\nBut here's the thing: technical expertise alone won't make you remarkable. It's your dedication to perfecting your craft that creates true mastery. The greatest experts, like Jiro who's been making sushi daily for 80 years straight, understand something most technologists never grasp.\n\nThis is an excerpt from the \ud83c\udf71 DevOps Sushi - Part 1 \ud83c\udfac movie that is now available on https:\/\/makeitwork.tv.

But if you\u2019re a DevOps or Kubernetes engineer, they are absolutely foundational.\n\nIn this video, you\u2019ll learn Linux package management the way it really matters in production as an ongoing operational responsibility, not a one-time setup task. We\u2019ll connect tools like yum, apt and dnf directly to Ansible, CI\/CD pipelines and Kubernetes nodes so you actually understand what you\u2019re automating.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll learn:\n00:00 - Why DevOps engineers must understand package managers\n01:01 - Package Management in Real Cloud & Enterprise Environments\n01:19 - How DevOps Engineers Actually Use Package Managers (Reality Check)\n01:29 - What You\u2019ll Learn in This Video (Scope & Expectations)\n01:59 - What Is a Package Manager?

The workflow includes archiving old files and ensuring only the latest data is available. See a live test showcasing how updates, like \"Brooke test take two\" and \"Yuriy test one,\" are reflected in the new CSV, complete with direct URL links to specific ADO work items. We also explore future possibilities, including potentially replacing the existing Software connector, pushing data directly to Smartsheet with hyperlinks and hierarchy, and achieving bidirectional integration.",

        "videoDescription":"CHECK OUT MY DEVOPS COURSE WITH 85% OFF COUPON AT https:\/\/sre.rs\n\nHello everyone,\n\n\nI've made a DevOps course covering a lot of different technologies and applications,\naimed at startups, small companies and individuals who want to self-host\ntheir infrastructure.\n\nTL;DR:\nCourse page: https:\/\/www.udemy.com\/course\/real-world-devops-project-from-start-to-finish\/?referralCode=9AC467077593D22878A2\nDiscount coupon is available at https:\/\/sre.rs\n\nDetails:\nTo get this out of the way - this course doesn't cover Kubernetes or similar -\nI'm of the opinion that for startups, small companies, and especially individuals,\nyou probably don't need Kubernetes. Unless you have a whole DevOps team,\nit usually brings more problems than benefits, and unnecessary infrastructure bills\nburied a lot of startups before they got anywhere.\n\nAs for prerequisites, you can't be a complete beginner in the world of computers.\nIf you've never even heard of Docker, if you don't know at least something about DNS,\nor if you don't have any experience with Linux, this course is probably not for you.\nThat being said, I do explain the basics too, but probably not in enough detail\nfor a complete beginner.\n\nI encourage you to watch \"free preview\" videos to get the sense of what\nwill be covered, but here's the gist:\n\nThe goal of the course is to create an easily deployable and reproducible server\nwhich will have \"everything\" a startup or a small company will need - VPN, mail, Git,\nCI\/CD, messaging, hosting websites and services, sharing files, calendar, etc.\nIt can also be useful to individuals who want to self-host all of those - I ditched Google 99.9%\nand other than that being a good feeling, I'm not worried that some AI bug will lock my account\nwith no one to talk to about resolving the issue.\n\nConsidering that it covers a wide variety of topics, it doesn't go in depth in any of those.\nThink of it as going down a highway towards the end destination, but on the way there I show you\nall the junctions where I think it's useful to do more research on the subject.\n\nWe'll deploy services inside Docker and LXC (Linux Containers). Those will include\na mail server (iRedMail), Zulip (Slack and Microsoft Teams alternative), GitLab (with GitLab Runner and CI\/CD),\nNextcloud (file sharing, calendar, contacts, etc.), checkmk (monitoring solution), Pi-hole (ad blocking on DNS level),\nTraefik with Docker and file providers (a single HTTP\/S entry point with automatic routing and TLS certificates).\n\nWe'll set up WireGuard, a modern and fast VPN solution for secure access to VPS' internal network,\nand I'll also show you how to get a wildcard TLS certificate with certbot and DNS provider.\n\nTo wrap it all up, we'll write a simple Python application that will compare a list of the desired backups\nwith the list of finished backups, and send a result to a Zulip stream.\nWe'll write the application, do a 'git push' to GitLab which will trigger a CI\/CD pipeline\nthat will build a Docker image, push it to a private registry, and then,\nwith the help of the GitLab runner, run it on the VPS and post a result to a Zulip stream with a webhook.\n\n\nIf you apply the coupon, I'd appreciate if you leave your feedback on Udemy\nafter you're done and spread the word about the course. It would mean a lot.\n\n\nI hope that you find it useful.\n\n\nHappy learning,\nPredrag",

It's the soundtrack for late-night coding sessions, for learning, and for the union between logic and emotion.\n\nLeave a comment and tell us which part of the lyrics resonated most with you! Do you feel this DNA-DevOps in your daily routine?\n\n(Evig Eies, forever owned, forever known...)\n\nVerse 1:\n(Piano and Cello begin, sparse and reflective)\nLines of code, a digital thread,\nWeaving futures, words unsaid.\nFrom concept's spark to a living stream,\nA silent promise, a waking dream.\nChorus:\n(Bass and drums enter, subtle and driving, clean electric guitar adds texture)\nOh, DNA-DevOps, a rhythm deep inside,\nWhere logic flows and errors hide.\nEvig Eies, a truth we hold so dear,\nBuilding bridges, conquering fear.\nVerse 2:\n(Vocals become more prominent, velvety and slightly melancholic)\nThrough countless iterations, we refine,\nEach commit, a purpose, a design.\nFrom whispered thoughts to a grand display,\nGuiding progress, lighting the way.\nChorus:\n(Instrumentation builds slightly, still restrained)\nOh, DNA-DevOps, a rhythm deep inside,\nWhere logic flows and errors hide.\nEvig Eies, a truth we hold so dear,\nBuilding bridges, conquering fear.\nBridge:\n(Cello takes a more melodic lead, piano arpeggios, drums become more intricate)\nIn the quiet hum of the server's grace,\nA human touch in this digital space.\nWe learn, we grow, we adapt, we mend,\nA cycle endless, without an end.\nChorus:\n(Fuller sound, but still maintaining the minimalist feel)\nOh, DNA-DevOps, a rhythm deep inside,\nWhere logic flows and errors hide.\nEvig Eies, a truth we hold so dear,\nBuilding bridges, conquering fear.\nOutro:\n(Instrumentation slowly fades, piano and cello linger)\nEvig Eies, forever owned, forever known...\nA silent promise, deeply sown.\n(Silence)\n\n#DNADevOps #EvigEies #CodingMusic #SoftwareEngineering #DevOps #IndieMusic #AmbientPop #TechMusic #CreationCycle #originalmusic",

We recommend splitting ETL and Modelling steps largely so you can manage those scripts separately. When everything is placed in a single master PBIX file or Project, it becomes nearly impossible to manage and govern. \n\nWe touch on governance in this video, but we do not go into detail. Ultimately, the application of your governance layers within your Power BI or Fabric environment must align with your corporate model. We do have recommendations, and we have seen success and failure in multiple organisations. This is not just about putting rules in place; really, the governance of Power BI has to fit your organisation to be successful. \n\nWe absolutely love Kerry Kolosko's site and if you are looking to start with SVG's she has a fantastic library to help you get started. \nhttps:\/\/kerrykolosko.com\/\n\nAs we approach the end of this series, we invite you to comment below on what you would like us to do next.

        "videoDescription":"This week on SysAdmin Weekly, Andy is joined by Luke Orellana, a fellow IT war buddy from the MSP trenches who's now a Senior Engineering Manager at Microsoft (yes, that Microsoft) working with AI Agents on a daily basis!\n\nIn this episode we unpack the good, the bad, and the \"seriously, who thought YAML was a good idea\"? parts of Infra-as-Code from Terraform and Pulumi to PowerShell DSC and Packer pipelines. Luke drops wisdom on platform engineering, the rise of AI agents with their impact on DevOps, and how he rewrote entire Terraform libraries because apparently, sleep is optional.\n\nAlso in this episode:\n\n- Why password resets are a scam (Forrester says $70 a pop \u2014 no thanks).\n- The glorious chaos of auditors asking for 30-day resets in 2025 (because security theater must go on).\n- Andy\u2019s obsession with Linux Mint Debian Edition and the Tux shrine on his desk.\n- The legendary Domino\u2019s Pizza Terraform provider. Yes. That\u2019s real.\n \nWe also answer critical questions like:\n\n- Can an AI agent wreck your entire Git repo?\n- Should sysadmins fear change or just automate it?\n- And what\u2019s more powerful: Terraform CDK or the sheer willpower of a sysadmin trying to avoid YAML?\n\nGrab your favorite caffeine source, commit to main (regrets optional), and get ready to laugh, learn, and question your life choices. This one\u2019s got code, chaos, and caffeine-fueled commentary.\n\nEpisode Resources Below!\n\n- SysAdmin Weekly Companion Newsletter - https:\/\/newsletter.sysadminweekly.com\n- All Available Podcast Platforms - https:\/\/www.sysadminweekly.com\n- AndyOnTech - https:\/\/www.andyontech.com\n- ProjectRunspace - https:\/\/www.projectrunspace.org\n- Luke Orellana on LinkedIn - https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/luke-orellana\/\n- Terraform CDK Constructs - https:\/\/github.com\/Azure\/terraform-cdk-constructs",

Hugo isn't a real engineer and therefore never learned how to write .yml in devops properly - but with AI it was very straightforward to:\n\n-- Build an action that parameterises key inputs like the branch name, environment, and other environment variables\n-- Trigger Orchestra Pipelines in staging environments with different configurations\n-- Implement polling logic to understand what pipelines are complete\n\nThe code for this example can be found at https:\/\/docs.getorchestra.io\/docs\/git-control-and-ci-cd\/ci-cd\/azure_devops\n\nReady to get started with Orchestra?

        "videoDescription":"Are you new to DevOps and wondering what Prometheus actually does? In this short video, we break it down in a simple, beginner-friendly way.\n\nPrometheus is a powerful open-source monitoring tool used by DevOps teams around the world. It pulls metrics from your servers, stores them as time-series data, and triggers alerts whenever thresholds are broken. This proactive approach helps teams detect issues before they impact users, improving uptime and system reliability.\n\nUnlike log-based monitoring, Prometheus focuses on quantitative metrics like CPU usage, memory consumption, response times, and error rates. By monitoring these metrics continuously, DevOps engineers and SREs (Site Reliability Engineers) can maintain healthy systems, reduce downtime, and scale cloud-native infrastructure efficiently.\n\nThis video is perfect for beginners who want to understand Prometheus in under 20 seconds and start applying monitoring in real-world projects. Whether you\u2019re managing corporate training platforms, retail applications, or cloud infrastructure, this knowledge is essential.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Save this video and follow the channel for more quick DevOps tutorials, beginner tips, and monitoring hacks.

        "videoDescription":"Welcome to Day 1  of Anisble in the DevOps Full Course by DevOpsFarm! \ud83d\ude80\n\nThis video transcript details a deep-dive tutorial on Ansible, the industry-leading Configuration as Code (CAC) tool.\n\nHere is a complete YouTube package, including the video description, chapters, and tags.\n\nYouTube Video Description\nThis is your complete, hands-on tutorial for Ansible, the powerful, agentless tool for Configuration as Code (CAC). We will show you how Ansible solves the major DevOps problem of managing and configuring hundreds of servers efficiently and consistently.\n\nWe begin by establishing the crucial difference between Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform (which creates machines) and Configuration as Code tools like Ansible (which configures those machines).\n\nWhat you will learn in this video:\n\n\u27a4 Configuration Management Fundamentals: Understand why manual scripting on multiple machines is inefficient and how Ansible automates security hardening, software installation (like PostgreSQL, Grafana), and application deployment.\n\n\u27a4 Ansible Architecture: Learn about the Controller Node and why Ansible is agentless, using standard SSH\/SCP protocols to manage hosts, unlike other tools that require an agent installation.\n\n\u27a4 Core Concepts Explained: Deep dive into the four essential elements of Ansible:\n\n\u27a4 Modules: The basic units of work (Python scripts) that perform specific tasks (e.g., ping, shell, mysql).\n\n\u27a4 Playbooks: YAML files that define a set of tasks to run on specific hosts.\n\n\u27a4 Inventory: The list of hosts (IPs, usernames) that Ansible manages.\n\n\u27a4 Idempotence: A key concept ensuring that running the same command multiple times yields the same, predictable outcome, preventing configuration drift.\n\n\u27a4 Terraform vs. Ansible: A clear comparison, including why Terraform is better suited for Cloud (like AWS) and configuration management tools are essential for On-Premise (data center) environments.\n\nChapters :-\nTimestamp Chapter Title\n00:00:28 Introducing Ansible: Configuration as Code (CAC)\n00:01:07 Review of the DevOps SDLC Pipeline (Plan, Code, Test, Deploy)\n00:03:28 Differentiating Terraform (IaC) vs. Configuration Management\n00:03:54 Terraform Limitations: Cloud vs. On-Premise Use Cases\n00:07:28 Defining On-Premise Infrastructure and Hypervisors\n00:08:50 The Need for Automation (The Configuration Problem)\n00:09:14 Configuration Tasks: Security Hardening, Software Installation, Monitoring Setup\n00:10:53 Why Configuration as Code (CAC) is a Must for Uniformity\n00:13:41 The Challenge: Manually Managing Configuration on 100+ Servers\n00:18:46 Introducing Ansible to Solve the Automation Challenge\n00:27:15 What is Ansible? (A Collection of Python Scripts)\n00:29:59 Key Feature: Idempotence Explained\n00:32:04 Ansible Architecture: Controller Node and Agentless Design\n00:33:37 Ansible Core Components: Modules (Shell, Database, etc.)\n00:35:48 Ansible Core Components: Playbooks (YAML), Inventory, and Roles\n00:44:22 The Advantage of Agentless Architecture (Using SSH)\n00:53:39 Introduction to Ansible Ad-Hoc Commands\n00:57:57 Testing Ad-Hoc Command Connectivity (Ping Module Demo)\n\n#Ansible\n#ConfigurationAsCode\n#CAC\n#ConfigurationManagement\n#DevOps\n#AnsibleTutorial\n#AnsibleAgentless\n#AnsibleModules\n#AnsiblePlaybooks\n#TerraformVsAnsible\n#InfrastructureAsCode\n#IAC\n#OnPremise\n#CloudComputing\n#Idempotence\n#Automation\n#DevOpsTools\n#Linux",

You will then be guided through provisioning the necessary AWS infrastructure using Terraform, establishing the Controller Node, and connecting it to the Managed Nodes.\n\nWhat you will learn in this session:\n\u27a4 Ansible Architecture: Reviewing the Controller Node and Managed Node design, and the vital role of Python on the Controller.\n\n\u27a4 Lab Setup: Provisioning three EC2 instances on AWS using Terraform to prepare for the demo.\n\n\u27a4 Running Commands: Understanding the two primary ways to run Ansible: Ad-Hoc Commands (for quick, one-shot testing and debugging) and Playbooks. \n\n\u27a4 Ansible Modules: Deep dive into how modules (like apt or yum) are used for specific tasks, and how to control them with parameters (e.g., present or absent).\n\n\u27a4 Mastering Inventory: A detailed breakdown of the hosts.ini file, including defining host addresses, setting connection variables (ansible_user, ansible_password), and logically organizing machines using Inventory Groups (e.g., front-end and back-end).\n\n\u27a4 Best Practices: How to use the [all:vars] section in your inventory to apply common configurations globally, adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.\n\n\u27a4 Advanced Topics: Introduction to Ansible Variables, Jinja2 Templating, and the concept of Ansible Roles for highly reusable, community-driven configurations (like installing PostgreSQL).\n\n00:00:16 \nRecap: Terraform (IaC) vs. Ansible (CAC) Differences \n\n\n00:01:11 \nReview of Ansible Components (Modules, Inventory, Playbooks, Roles) \n\n00:02:18 \nAnsible Architecture: Controller Node and Managed Nodes \n\n00:02:37 \nController Node Requirements: Python & Ansible Dependency \n\n00:04:16 \nLab Setup: Provisioning 3 AWS Machines using Terraform \n\n\n00:10:53 \nTwo Ways to Run Ansible: Ad-Hoc Commands vs. Playbooks \n\n00:11:38 \nAd-Hoc Commands: Use Cases (Quick Testing & Debugging) \n\n\n00:12:12 \nDeep Dive into Ansible Modules (e.g., Package Installation) \n\n\n\n00:13:22 \nAnsible Inventory Explained (The hosts.ini file) \n\n00:14:30 \nConfiguring Inventory: ansible_user and ansible_password \n\n00:15:39 \nOrganizing Hosts with Inventory Groups (Front-end\/Back-end) \n\n00:27:54 \nDRY Principle: Using [all:vars] for Global Configuration \n\n00:30:48 \nHands-on: Using the shell Module to Run OS Commands \n\n01:23:25 \nAnsible Variables and Special Variables \n\n01:26:19 \nIntroduction to Jinja2 Templating \n\n\n01:46:51 \nReusable Code and Ansible Roles (Postgres Example)\n\n#Ansible\n#ConfigurationAsCode\n#AnsibleTutorial\n#AnsibleInventory\n#AnsibleModules\n#AnsibleAdHoc\n#AnsibleRoles\n#TerraformVsAnsible\n#DevOps\n#IaC\n#CAC\n#AWS\n#EC2\n#LinuxAutomation\n#Jinja2\n#Automation\n#DevOpsTools",
