In this video, Liz and Seth discuss the differences and similarities between DevOps and SRE, ultimately realizing that DevOps and SRE aren't two competing methods, but rather close friends designed help break down organizational barriers to deliver better software faster. DevOps is like an abstract class in programming, and SRE is one possible implementation of that class.\n\nSite Reliability Engineering: https:\/\/goo.gl\/aCiiPV\nHow SRE relates to DevOps: https:\/\/goo.gl\/NWKuj9\nManaging Deployments with Kubernetes Engine Qwiklab: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2zdFQh5\n\nReach out to Liz and Seth:\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/sethvargo\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/lizthegrey\n\nWatch more episodes from the playlist here: https:\/\/goo.gl\/CKv3tV\nSubscribe to the Google Cloud Platform channel for more Cloud content: https:\/\/goo.gl\/S0AS51",

It has become a buzzword within days of its release and professionals in all fields, especially in high skilled areas like lawyers, doctors, engineers are questioning whether such AI can actually replace them and work.\n\nSo in this video I want to talk about what ChatGPT is and how it even popped up, talk a bit about the organization behind GPT called \"OpenAI\", which has already created many other machine learning models besides Chat GPT and also explain technically about all that.\nAnd then we'll dive in and actually put ChatGPT to use for some DevOps related tasks.\nI really want to see how it can help in generating configuration code for building DevOps processes or different parts of those processes and how well it knows different DevOps technologies, but not just some shallow examples or boilerplate code that I can get from official documentation, but instead also try more fine-tuning and small optimizations in that configuration code.\n\nWe're also going to check out an open source command line tool that is built on top of ChatGPT and was specifically created for engineers to generate infrastructure as code templates and more and finally we'll talk about the impact of ChatGPT, the quality and usefulness of such a tool for engineers and whether it will really replace the engineers and to what extent you should be concerned.\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac T I M E S T A M P S \u23f0  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n00:00 - Intro and Overview\n01:39 - What is ChatGPT, Who developed ChatGPT\n06:45 - Sign Up on ChatGPT\n09:23 - Create Dockerfile for Node.js app using ChatGPT\n22:13 - Create Kubernetes manifest file using ChatGPT\n35:06 - Create CI\/CD pipeline code using ChatGPT\n50:06 - Convert Jenkinsfile into GitLab CI config file\n53:53 - Tools built on top of OpenAI's API\n55:01 - AIaC demo - CLI tool for DevOps\n01:01:00 - My opinion on ChatGPT & whether ChatGPT will replace engineers\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Want to learn more? \ud83d\ude80  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nFull Python course                                            \u25ba  https:\/\/youtu.be\/t8pPdKYpowI\nFull Docker course                                            \u25ba  https:\/\/youtu.be\/3c-iBn73dDE\nFull K8s course                                                  \u25ba  https:\/\/youtu.be\/X48VuDVv0do\nDevOps Tools explained                                   \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/2W9UEq6\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Connect with me \ud83d\udc4b   \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nINSTAGRAM             \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/2F3LXYJ\nTWITTER                   \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/3i54PUB\nLINKEDIN                  \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/3hWOLVT\nFB group                   \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/32UVSZP\nDEV                            \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/3h2fqiO\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Courses & Ebooks & Bootcamp \ud83d\ude80      \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \n\u25ba Become a DevOps Engineer - full educational program             \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc   https:\/\/bit.ly\/45mXaer\n\u25ba High-Quality and Hands-On Courses                                             \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc   https:\/\/bit.ly\/3BNS8Kv\n\u25ba Kubernetes 101 - compact and easy-to-read ebook bundle      \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc   https:\/\/bit.ly\/3Ozl28x",

But there is a lot of mix up of these two roles and many people and many companies often use them interchangeably. They mix the tasks and responsibilities of these two very often. For example there are plenty of job descriptions for \"DevOps Cloud Engineer\" or \"Cloud DevOps Engineer\", which would naturally make you think that they are the same role, but then why would you have two names for the same role?

There is a lot of discussion going on, where some people are asking whether platform engineering replaces DevOps. Many people say it goes hand in hand and is rather an addition to DevOps, but in reality it's a bit more complicated than that. Platform engineering actually changes a lot of established rules we knew about DevOps, SRE and Cloud engineering, it changes the game and introduces some new rules.\n\nSo let's clearly define, what platform engineering exactly is, more interestingly, why was there even a need for this new role and how it evolved and of course how it compares to DevOps and Cloud engineering and does it really replace any of these roles?\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac T I M E S T A M P S \u23f0  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n0:00 - Intro and Overview\n0:50 - Why Platform Engineering?

In this video, we're sharing the top 5 DevOps certifications that are likely to be in high demand in 2023.\nDevOps certifications are one of the best ways to show hiring managers that you're qualified for a technical position. They're also a great way to set yourself up for more advanced career opportunities.\n\n\n\nIn this video we will cover the following topics:\n\n00:00 -  Introduction\n01:42 - Why Certifications are Important\n03:35 - Python Certification\n05:30 - Docker\n06:15 - Kubernetes\n08:22 - Terraform\n08:57 - Linux\n10:16 - Conclusion\n\nWant to view a clear path to becoming a DevOps Engineer? Visit our website - www.kodekloud.com\nWe have various Learning Paths to help you choose your next step and shape your DevOps Career. \n\nCheck out our learning paths at KodeKloud to get started:\n\n -Linux: https:\/\/bit.ly\/LinuxLearningPath\n- DevOps Learning Path: https:\/\/bit.ly\/DevOpsLearningPath-YT\n -Docker: https:\/\/bit.ly\/DockerLearningPath\n -Kubernetes: https:\/\/bit.ly\/KubernetesLearningPath\n -Infrastructure as Code(IAC): https:\/\/bit.ly\/IACLearningPath\n -Programming: https:\/\/bit.ly\/ProgrammingLearningPath\n\n \nThose new to the Programming and DevOps world often find it challenging to start their journey due to the missing basic prerequisites. For example, issues with setting up a basic lab environment using VirtualBox, problems with networking, or trouble with working with the Linux CLI or text editors like vi editor. Sometimes there are issues with applications - like getting a sample application to work, problems with getting the dependencies to install correctly or trouble with getting a web server to communicate with a database server. Or, at other times, it's working with data formats like JSON or YAML.\n\nSo we have identified a gap, and we believe that this is due to missing some of the basic prerequisites, such as knowing the basics of Linux, the basics of tools like VirtualBox, or knowing the basics of the most commonly used applications like Java, Python or NodeJS or web servers like Apache, NGINX etc. As a DevOps or Cloud Engineer, it is crucial to have these basics cleared.

In this episode, Liz and a very sleepy Seth discuss how to build actionable alerts from your SLOs and SLIs as a Site Reliability Engineer. Alerting on low-level metrics such as CPU usage or disk space doesn't actually show whether our users are experiencing issues with our product or service. Instead, we should build our alerts using our SLOs. By integrating our remaining error budget over time, we can see how outages or partial outages will affect our SLO. Liz discusses strategies for deciding when to alert, how to alert, and what to do with those old alerts.\n\nActionable alerts tie closely into the DevOps principles of expecting failure and creating a blameless culture. This is why we say \"class SRE implements DevOps\".\n\nReference Links:\nStackdriver Service Monitoring \u2192 http:\/\/bit.ly\/2wJdVS7\nCreating a Dashboard with Stackdriver SLI Monitoring Metrics \u2192 http:\/\/bit.ly\/2wHwGWo\n\nHave questions?

An engineer, in love with his job, started teaching on the side. Got lucky. Impacted 1000s of lives. Had to finally leave his job to increase the impact surface area. Raised $5M funding to fix education. Is learning day and day about startups and building a valuable product. \n\nHow is it going? A decade of engineering helps in systems thinking and product building. Learning about Strategy, Marketing, People Management, and Finance on the go. \n\nWhat am I building? Today, 25 million Indians prepare for government job entrance exams. They do it for years together. The probability of success is less than 1% but they still do it. Why? For the lack of a structured alternative to launch their white-collar career. I am building Invact to bridge this gap. \nHow? Follow me to know, it's a long story.

        "videoDescription":"DevOps Engineer Cherwin Nooitmeer on the complexity of Kubernetes and the future of DevOps.\n\n\u201cThe future of DevOps is going to be boring\u201d\n\nWhat is DevOps?\nThere are programmers that write software that need to run on computers, we call them servers. And when a programmer writes software, someone needs to put that software on the computers. So people like you and me can access facebook.com and see pictures of cats. Right?\n\nThe process from getting the software from a developer to one of the computers that Facebook has, because you can imagine, they have a lot of them. How you do that, that is where DevOps comes in.\n\nSo you write software and you have to put it in production. The gap in between, that's where my focus is. And I try to reduce that gap, so it's instant basically.\n\nWhy DevOps?\nCompanies have started to realize, if you have good DevOps processes you can deliver value to the customer faster. You can just outperform all competitors.\n\nWhat\u2019s the future of DevOps?\nThe future of DevOps, I hope, from my perspective, is going to be boring. DevOps will develop and become more mature. We will get better tools and better ways of doing things, like testing and doing infrastructure in a way that is reliable and fast. Hopefully, my job will be as a commodity so I can work on other things and add even more value to customers.\n\nWhat is Kubernetes?\nSo what we need to do is to make sure we can run software, that we can update it, roll back things, etcetera. These are similar things that every company needs to do.\n\nSo Google came and they basically understood and standardized the way of rolling out software and deploying it to users, making sure everything works fine. They basically extracted their learnings into a product. And that product is Kubernetes. People like I use Kubernetes to build platforms so we can enable companies to deliver value to customers faster.\n\nWhat I do think about Kubernetes is that when people see it, they see it\u2019s awesome and they all try to use it. I think that's a mistake.\n\nIs the hype real?\nThere\u2019s a lot of hype around Kubernetes. But Kubernetes also adds a lot of complexity. And I think the complexity gets overshadowed by the hype. People think it\u2019s fine and it just works and you can use it.\n\nBut what I do think, this complexity that is there is necessary. Because if you are not going to use the complexity of Kubernetes, you are going to create your own system that you need to maintain and develop. Because it's not only software that we use to service users. You also need to write software to service the servers, if that makes any sense. Right?\n\nAnd if you are going to write it yourself. What happens if you hire a new guy? Now you have to explain to the new guy how your complexity works. So instead of using a complexity that everyone knows, you\u2019re going to create your own complexity. And now you have to teach everybody about your own complexity. And then you need to maintain it.\n\nSo this is a trade-off, what are you going to do? I mean, if you have a very simple problem and can get away with having less complexity. Then maybe Kubernetes is not the right thing for you.\n\nCoder Society is a professional community of senior freelance developers, designers, and product managers.\n\nJoin our journey: https:\/\/codersociety.com\n#Kubernetes #k8s #DevOps",

        "videoDescription":"This video captures my presentation delivered at the DevOps Meetup in Z\u00fcrich on January 25, 2024, where I delve into the prevalent challenges faced by traditional DevOps methodologies, characterized by isolated teams and fragmented value streams that impede efficiency. It explores DevOps as a holistic culture, mindset, and suite of technical practices designed to foster continuous value delivery, prioritize products over projects, and focus on customer-centric development. Additionally, I introduce Platform Engineering as a strategic evolution of DevOps aimed at mitigating the technical and operational complexities encountered when scaling DevOps in larger enterprises. Highlighting a collaborative project with LGT and Z\u00fchlke, I present the Platform Plane case study, demonstrating how an internal developer platform can streamline and standardize DevOps processes across various teams, thereby reducing cognitive load and enhancing productivity. This presentation goes beyond theoretical discussion, offering a hands-on demonstration of the Platform Plane and its functionalities, including Kubernetes as a service, API gateway, and Service Mesh, among others. It illustrates the vital role of Platform Engineering in enabling product teams to adopt DevOps more efficiently and effectively, leading to an optimized development lifecycle.\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac T I M E S T A M P S \u23f0  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n00:00 Intro\n00:08 Welcome\n00:31 About me\n02:36 Today's challenges\n04:33 DevOps is here to help\n05:20 Who is DevOps?\n06:44 The Benefit of DevOps\n08:05 DevOps is bullshit?\n08:27 What are the Challenges with DevOps?\n08:59 You build it you run it\n10:18 Think about that on scale.\n11:06 Can you scale DevOps?\n11:23 Example of What companies want\n15:50 The Digital Factory \n16:35 Platform Engineering Enables DevOps in Product Teams.\n18:30 The Gartner Top Strategic Technology Trends for 2024. \n19:29 Platform Engineering Improves DevOps Efficiency.\n20:24 The Platform Plane: Big Picture.\n22:04 The Platform Plane: High Level Architecture\n21:56 Demo 1 - The Admin Areas\n25:56 Demo 2 - Platform Plane\n26:01 Platform Plane- Main page\n26:27 Documentations\n27:38 AI Assistant\n29:21 Platform plane:\n30:12 - GitLab\n30:44 - Repositories \n32:13 - Registry\n33:40 - Package Management\n36:42 - Hypervisor ( virtual machines)\n36:52 - Identity \n37:56- Chat\n39:07 Summary\n39:45 Outro\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac  L I N K S  \ud83d\udd17\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nPlatform Plane: \n\u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/rSUI6-R4DlM\n\nLGT: \n\u27a4 https:\/\/www.lgt.com\/\n\nZ\u00fchlke: \n\u27a4 https:\/\/www.zuehlke.com\/\n\nDevOps Meetup Z\u00fcrich: \n\u27a4 https:\/\/www.meetup.com\/devops-meetup-zurich\/\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Want to learn more? \ud83d\ude80  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \n\nYou're developing products, not projects \n\u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/ImbhUFr6suw?si=UeSOAR67hZcJWE5T\n\nDevOps \n\u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/Ath3XoLbYxY?si=xzJzs4Fqpst6uxqm\n\nApply continous testing and build-in quality \n\u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/W0QZRpf7ElM?si=oe54rFG0uEXtHUbJ\n\nApply continous security \n\u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/340YmM08Eb0?si=QFOGkCnUElDXevR-\n\nBuild a platform\n \u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/UE8mSt55xHw?si=cc6_S_6Wv6iwA_y1\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac  S U B S C R I B E  \ud83d\udd14 \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \n\u2554\u2550\u2566\u2557\u2554\u2566\u2557\u2554\u2550\u2566\u2550\u2566\u2566\u2566\u2566\u2557\u2554\u2550\u2557\n\u2551\u255a\u2563\u2551\u2551\u2551\u255a\u2563\u255a\u2563\u2554\u2563\u2554\u2563\u2551\u255a\u2563\u2550\u2563\n\u2560\u2557\u2551\u255a\u255d\u2551\u2551\u2560\u2557\u2551\u255a\u2563\u2551\u2551\u2551\u2551\u2551\u2550\u2563\n\u255a\u2550\u2569\u2550\u2550\u2569\u2550\u2569\u2550\u2569\u2550\u2569\u255d\u255a\u2569\u2550\u2569\u2550\u255d\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCXvlc9x4zlv5DEqbby55Ivg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Connect with me \ud83d\udc4b  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nLINKEDIN                  \u25ba https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/romanoroth\/\nTWITTER                   \u25ba https:\/\/twitter.com\/RomanoRoth\nINSTAGRAM             \u25ba https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/romanoroth\/\nFACEBOOK               \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/romanoroth\/\nMEETUP                   \u25ba https:\/\/www.meetup.com\/de-DE\/DevOps-Meetup-Zurich\/\nCONFERNCE            \u25bahttps:\/\/www.devopsdays.ch\/\nHOMEPAGE              \u25ba  https:\/\/www.romanoroth.com\/\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac  P L A Y L I S T S  \u25b6\ufe0f \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nModern Software Engineering\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLrsbMazVPK_rb56rZQr2fyBGR3cyanZpX\nDevOps\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLrsbMazVPK_ro3fn1G-3Ui2mBPHxOD9kF\nGitLab: Build a DevSecOps Pipeline\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLrsbMazVPK_qhf3ahA_zRPlwBaGGhSu2P\n\n#devsecops  #devops #romanoroth #platformengineering",

SSH or Secure Shell is a cryptographic network protocol designed for secure data communication. It is often used in passwordless authentication scenarios, improving the productivity and security of developers.\n\nWorking with Azure DevOps, an all-inclusive suite of development tools provided by Microsoft, can be significantly enhanced by using SSH. Azure DevOps comprises various services including Azure Repos, which is a set of version control tools that help developers manage their code. Azure Repos is versatile in that it supports both Git and Team Foundation Version Control.\n\nOne of the ways to interact with Azure Repos is using Git, a popular open-source version control system. When using Git with Azure Repos, developers have the flexibility to work with their codebase using various Git clients, including the popular VS Code. However, to establish a secure connection between these clients and Azure Repos, proper authentication is crucial.\n\nThis is where SSH comes in. Using SSH, you can authenticate to Azure DevOps, and particularly, Azure Git Repositories, without entering your username and password every time. This not only saves time but also minimizes the risk of your credentials being exposed.\n\nThis guide aims to help developers configure SSH for Azure DevOps, understand how to clone Azure Git Repos using SSH, and embrace passwordless and public key authentication methods for seamless and secure operations. Whether you're an IT professional, software engineer, or someone interested in learning about DevOps, this information will equip you with valuable insights into SSH integration and usage.\n\nThis video is about:-\nSSH Authentication\nAzure DevOps Tutorials\nAzure Repos\nAzure Git Repositories \nVS Code with Azure DevOps\nGit Authentication\nClone Azure Git Repo with SSH\nHow to use SSH authentication with Azure DevOps \nSsh passwordless authentication\nSsh with public key authentication \nUsing SSH to authenticate Git in Azure DevOps\nClone git Repository using SSH in Azure DevOps\n\n#AzureDevOps #git #softwareengineering",

        "videoDescription":"Dive into the transformative world of DevOps in the embedded industry with me. This video brings to life my presentation from the DevOps Meetup in Munich on November 15, 2023, offering a deep dive into the evolution of software development methodologies and the pivotal role of DevOps in driving innovation.\n\nEmbark on a journey from the constrained waterfall methodologies to the agile landscape, where a product-centric approach addresses real customer needs. Discover the challenges that plague the industry, from legacy systems and budget constraints to the \"wall of confusion\" that disrupts effective collaboration. More than a strategy to overcome these hurdles, DevOps emerges as a culture of collaboration, inclusivity, and continuous improvement.\n\nExperience the power of DevOps through the success stories of industry giants like Tesla and SpaceX, illustrating how Agile and DevOps principles can elevate a company's market position. Gain insights into the essential capabilities for enhancing software delivery performance, inspired by the seminal book \"Accelerate.\"\n\nLearn about the critical role of Platform Engineering and the Digital Factory model in embedding DevOps practices within product teams. This innovative approach not only simplifies the development process but also ensures consistency and fosters an environment ripe for continuous value delivery and breakthrough innovation.\n\nJoin me in this exploration of DevOps' potential to revolutionize the embedded industry, paving the way for future advancements.

Request only private parallel jobs unless you have a valid reason for public jobs.\n\nApproval Timeframe: It typically takes 24 to 48 hours for Microsoft to approve parallel job requests.\n\nVerification: After approval, you can verify the availability of parallel jobs in the Azure DevOps portal under the \"Parallel Jobs\" section in the billing settings.\n\nBilling Setup for Additional Jobs: For additional parallel jobs, users need an active Azure subscription (e.g., Pay-As-You-Go), and setup billing, linking it to the Azure subscription. This will allow for purchasing more parallel jobs if needed.\n\n\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83c\udfeb This complete tutorial is compiled by Sandeep Soni, a Microsoft Certified Trainer, a Software & Corporate Trainer for 27years!  \nFor more Training Courses Visit: https:\/\/www.bestitcourses.com\n\n\ud83d\udcf2 \ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf0\ud835\ude01 \ud835\ude04\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf5 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff\ud83d\udc4b \nCall Sandeep Soni for Career Guidance \u25ba +91 98490 01840 \nConnect with me on LINKEDIN \u25ba https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/sandeepsoni123\/ \n \n\ud83d\udc4d \ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb'\ud835\ude01 \ud835\uddd9\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf4\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude01 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddfc \n- Like the video if you found it helpful. \n- Subscribe to our channel for more DevOps tutorials and certification guides. \n- Hit the bell icon to get notified of our latest videos. \n\n\ud83d\udcac Join the Conversation \nHave questions or need further clarification?

        "videoDescription":"Start your DevOps Career (Beginners - Advanced) - https:\/\/bit.ly\/DevOpsLearningPath-YT\n\nDevOps is a buzzword. It\u2019s huge right now in the tech community, and it\u2019s definitely becoming more central to how teams build software.\nIf you\u2019re starting with DevOps, this video will help you understand the basics and give you a good head-start on your journey. You will also learn about the different stages in DevOps, what tools are needed at each stage, and how potential problems should be handled.\n\nStart your DevOps Career (Beginners - Advanced) - https:\/\/bit.ly\/DevOpsLearningPath-YT\n\nIn this video we will cover the following topics:\n\n00:00 -  Introduction\n00:27 - Problems before DevOps\n01:33 - Two Stages of DevOps\n02:12 - Real World Scenario 1\n03:28 - Real World Scenario 2\n04:12 - Automation\n05:06 - Benefits of DevOps\n06:10 - Summary\n07:22 - Conclusion\n \nThose new to the Programming and DevOps world often find it challenging to start their journey due to the missing basic prerequisites. For example, issues with setting up a basic lab environment using VirtualBox, problems with networking, or trouble with working with the Linux CLI or text editors like vi editor. Sometimes there are issues with applications - like getting a sample application to work, problems with getting the dependencies to install correctly or trouble with getting a web server to communicate with a database server. Or, at other times, it's working with data formats like JSON or YAML.\n\nSo we have identified a gap, and we believe that this is due to missing some of the basic prerequisites, such as knowing the basics of Linux, the basics of tools like VirtualBox, or knowing the basics of the most commonly used applications like Java, Python or NodeJS or web servers like Apache, NGINX etc. As a DevOps or Cloud Engineer, it is crucial to have these basics cleared. And that\u2019s why we are helping you to bridge that gap!\n\nWant to view a clear path to becoming a DevOps Engineer? Visit our website kodekloud.com!\nWe have various Learning Paths to help you choose your next step and shape your DevOps Career. \n\nCheck out our learning paths at KodeKloud to get started:\n\n -Linux: https:\/\/bit.ly\/LinuxLearningPath\n- DevOps Learning Path: https:\/\/bit.ly\/DevOpsLearningPath-YT\n -Docker: https:\/\/bit.ly\/DockerLearningPath\n -Kubernetes: https:\/\/bit.ly\/KubernetesLearningPath\n -Infrastructure as Code(IAC): https:\/\/bit.ly\/IACLearningPath\n -Programming: https:\/\/bit.ly\/ProgrammingLearningPath\n\nFor more updates on courses and tips, follow us on:\n-Website: https:\/\/kodekloud.com\/\n-LinkedIn: https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/kode...\n-Twitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/kodekloud1\n-Facebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/kodekloudtra...\n-Instagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/kodekloud\/\n-Blog: https:\/\/kodekloud.com\/blog\/\n\n#devops  #devopsengineer  #kodekloud",

Do you feel bridged between confusion and understanding when it comes to networking?\n\nWell, fret no more! Welcome to the \"Networking for DevOps\" playlist, your bridge to building a stronger, faster, and more reliable network.\n\nWe'll start from the ground floor, explaining the basics like LANs (think of them as your local neighborhood!) and how networks connect your devices, just like roads connect towns. We'll unpack the OSI model, which is like a recipe for understanding how information travels across the internet.\n\nWe'll even crack the code of IP addresses and subnets, and show you how data travels around the world, like a friendly little traveler with its own suitcase full of information.\n\nSo, who is eligible for this course?\nI'd say, no matter who you are in the technical part of software industry. A developer, A DevOps, A tester, learning networks is must for each one of you\nWhether you're a beginner just starting out or a seasoned engineer looking for a refresher, this playlist is for you.\n\nIn the next video we are going to talk about the roadmap, or the topics that I am going to in this course.\n\nSo join us on this educational journey and bridge the gap between confusion and networking mastery. Let's build a network that's as fast and efficient as you are!\n\nHey there, network newbies!

Today we observe in the industry that software is written, integrated, and tested in long cycles. However, receiving feedback and experiencing the functionality of the software early and often is crucial to avoid issues. Vehicle DevOps is a way of creating a constant development flow with short feedback cycles. In this talk Michael Fait highlights current challenges for in-vehicle software development, introduces the concept of Vehicle Devops, and discusses its approaches to increase engineering effectiveness.\n\nMichael Fait, Head of Autonomous Vehicle Tech, Thoughtworks",

        "videoDescription":"Is Platform Engineering Replacing DevOps? | DevOps vs Platform Engineering Explained\n\nIn today\u2019s video, I dive deep into the evolving landscape of DevOps and Platform Engineering, two concepts shaping the future of modern software development. With years of hands-on experience in DevOps, I bring you a unique perspective, exploring their differences, similarities, and why Platform Engineering isn\u2019t replacing DevOps, but rather enhancing it.\n\n\ud83d\udc49In This Video, You'll Discover:\n\n\u2b07\ufe0fWhat is DevOps?\nLearn the fundamental principles of DevOps and how it bridges the gap between development and operations teams to improve collaboration and efficiency.\n\n\u2b07\ufe0fWhat is Platform Engineering?\nExplore how Platform Engineering aims to create a seamless developer experience by building an Internal Developer Platform (IDP), standardizing tools, and optimizing workflows to support scalable application delivery.\n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDevOps vs Platform Engineering:\nIs Platform Engineering replacing DevOps? I unpack why Platform Engineering complements DevOps by streamlining processes and reducing inefficiencies, without overshadowing the core values of DevOps.\n\n\u27a1\ufe0fWhy You Should Care:\nAs software development practices evolve, so do the needs of teams. While DevOps has been foundational in creating faster, reliable, and scalable software, Platform Engineering is becoming the backbone that allows organizations to scale those processes. IDPs, automation, and standardization help reduce redundant work and enable developers to focus on high-value tasks. The result? Better software, faster.\n\n\u21aa\ufe0fKey Takeaways:\n\ud83d\udc49DevOps is a cultural shift, aiming for collaboration and agility between development and operations teams.\n\n\ud83d\udc49Platform Engineering builds infrastructure to empower developers, treating the platform as a product with IDPs that facilitate smoother deployments and continuous delivery.\n\n\ud83d\udc49Both practices are vital. Platform Engineering enhances DevOps by providing tools and processes that improve scalability and efficiency.\n\n\u2705Join the Discussion!\nHave you worked with Platform Engineering or DevOps?

        "videoDescription":"After watching this video, you will find out who IT technicians, sysadmins, and system engineers are. Why is there so much hype around DevOps right now? How do engineers differ from administrators? And what highly specialized professions are system administrators divided into?\n\nTimestamps:\n0:00 Intro\n1:07 IT technicians a.k.a. Desktop Support Engineers & Administrators\n2:49 System Engineers & Administrators\n4:38 Network Engineers & Administrators\n6:07 Information Security Specialists a.k.a. Cyber Security Engineers\n7:13 DevOps Engineers\n9:27 Things To Remember\n\nIT technicians (also known as Desktop Support Engineers) in most organizations are responsible for laptops, PBXs, printers, scanners, etc.\n\nSystem engineers are responsible for complex IT systems design, and administrators work with the existing systems. Both are more about networks, servers, and other complex hardware.\n\nIn large organizations, the aspects of system administration are often divided into narrow specializations: networks, web administration, information security.\n\nDevOps engineers are indispensable persons in companies with development teams and continuous integration (online games, streaming platforms, large retailers, and other services with an audience of thousands). They are responsible for smooth development, testing, and deployment.\n\n------------------------------------\nCREDITS\n\nI.

It's distributed so people around the world can share code\n2. It does version control\n\nSo, with version control, you can take snapshots of the state of your current code and maintain a history.\n\nBranching is really the third thing. Git branches allow developers to do isolated development and take chances without messing up the main branch.\n\nSo when someone asks me 'What is Git?', that is how I typically respond.",

        "videoDescription":"In this series we will learn the concepts of DevOps from a perspective of developers. How can these concepts help us be better developers and managers in our day to day jobs. In a startup you might need to fill the shoes of a DevOps, in a big company you might need to communicate with a DevOps team that has wildly different ideas.\n\nWe will gain a different perspective and understanding of the entire process by leaving our comfort zone and focusing on the wider picture. We will learn about different disciplines such as platform engineering and so much more.\n\nIn the first installment we discuss version control. As developers, we see it as a tool to collaborate and save our code. To track our mistakes and changes. In this video we learn why it's a crucial nexus point with the DevOps team and how we can work better to enable that.\n\n\u2705  You can see the article that goes with this post here: https:\/\/debugagent.com\/devops-for-developers-introduction-and-version-control\n\n\u2705  Check out the full series in the blog here: https:\/\/debugagent.com\/series\/devops4dev\n\n\u2705  Check out the playlist for this series here: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2HatFLh4xoA&list=PL8GhfcywW9YOA5i7kEFdNYFuluotS2JTZ\n\n\u2705  Check out https:\/\/debugagent.com\/ for other great content.\n\nTitle: DevOps 4 Devs-Introduction: Basic DevOps Tools & Version Control | git\n\n===============================\n\n\u2705  Subscribe To Channel For More Great Content on debugging and programming: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@debugagent \n\n\u2705  Stay Connected With Me.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Twitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/debugagent \n\ud83d\udc49 LinkedIn: https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/shai-almog-81a42\/ \n\ud83d\udc49 Website: https:\/\/debugagent.com\/ \n\ud83d\udc49 GitHub: https:\/\/github.com\/shai-almog \n\ud83d\udc49 Mastodon: https:\/\/mastodon.social\/@debugagent \n\n=============================\n\n\u2705  Recommended Playlists: \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Practical Debugging at Scale Course - Module 1: \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=A919j_5qE0k&list=PL8GhfcywW9YM3OsfxnaxAci6dJgkuOQWn \n\n\u2705  Other Videos You Might Be Interested In Watching: \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Practical Debugging at Scale Part 3: Watch and Evaluate   \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DGjVVKCNosM \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Practical Debugging at Scale Part 2: Program Control Flow   \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=GSeg5L31XXw \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Practical Debugging at Scale Part 1: Introduction   \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=A919j_5qE0k \n\n=============================\n\n\ud83d\udd14 Subscribe to our channel for more videos on debugging and programming: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@debugagent \n\n=================================\n\nDisclaimer: We do not accept any liability for any loss or damage which is incurred from you acting or not acting as a result of listening to any of our publications.

To learn more check out https:\/\/debugagent.com\/\n\nThis channel contains videos that comprise the first module covering debugging. Here we focus on IntelliJ\/IDEA and  Java\/JVM but the basic logic and tooling should be applicable to many other IDEs and platforms. We discuss debugging features that are niche and often unknown e.g.:\n\n* Marker Objects\n* Entry Renderers\n* Instance tracking\n* Memory object inspection\n* Tracepoints\/Logpoints\n\nand much more!\n\nBy leveraging these tools and techniques you will gain access to the secret weapon of senior developers and consultants. This will make you a better developer and a happier one. \n\nIn the following modules we cover:\n* Debugging Theory\n* Tooling\n* Writing Debuggable Code\n* Kubernetes (k8s)\n* Serverless\n* Fullstack\n* Observability \n\nThe full course includes more than 5 hours of video material.",

OPA provides a high-level declarative language that lets us specify policies as code and simple APIs to offload policy decision-making from our software. We can use OPA to enforce policies in microservices, Kubernetes, CI\/CD pipelines, API gateways, and more. \nIn kubernetes, OPA uses admission controllers.\n\nWhat is OPA Gatekeeper?\n\nOPA Gatekeeper is a specialized project providing first-class integration between OPA and Kubernetes.\nOPA Gatekeeper adds the following on top of plain OPA:\n\u25cf An extensible, parameterized policy library.\n\u25cf Native Kubernetes CRDs for instantiating the policy library (aka \u201cconstraints\u201d).\n\u25cf Native Kubernetes CRDs for extending the policy library (aka \u201cconstraint templates\u201d).\n\u25cf Audit functionality.\n\nWhy you need Gatekeeper?\n\nAs a Platform DevOps engineer managing multiple Kubernetes clusters for various projects, you face challenges when users deploy applications without adhering to best practices. Key issues include:\n  1.     Lack of ownership unless users apply labels themselves.\n  2.     No resource limits, leading to high costs.\n  3.     Untrusted images impacting other applications.\n  4.     Security and best practice violations across clusters.\n\nTo address these, we need governance to enforce limits and rules via policies. OPA Gatekeeper can be configured to implement these policies, ensuring best practices are followed.\n\nFollow my mentors too : @PavanElthepu    @MPrashant   @GouravSharma   @cloudwithraj   @AntonPutra   @AbhishekVeeramalla   @kubesimplify   @kshindi   @DevOpsJourney \n\nTags : #prometheus   #secrets #docker  #k8s #kubernetes #cncf #rbac #serverless #grafana #autoscaling #deployment  #opensource #devops #grafana #vault #terraform #kustomize #etcd #controlplane #container #opa #dockerhub #gatekeeper",

Over the past 1.5 years, I have been leveraging the power of podcasts to achieve this goal, inviting experienced professionals in the field to share their knowledge and insights with my audience.  My main agenda with this initiative is to build a testing mindset among students, as I believe that this is a crucial skill in today's software development landscape. By targeting those from less privileged backgrounds and areas, I hope to bridge the gap in knowledge and exposure to this field, opening up new opportunities for growth and development.

This ignite talk is a walk through just one person\u2019s career for the last\u2026 some years and looks at what we\u2019ve been talking about, building, worrying about, and finishing in that time; with hopefully some upcoming trends for the future (DevRel?

Their job includes coming up with innovative recipes, testing them, and adding the successful ones to the menu. At the same time, they also prepare food to meet the regular demand of customers who visit the restaurant daily. This dual responsibility of innovation and ongoing service can become overwhelming, especially during busy hours when the kitchen is already at full capacity.\n\nWait staff, on the other hand, focus on delivering the prepared food to customers. Their primary role is to ensure that the food reaches the diners promptly and in perfect condition, keeping the restaurant\u2019s operations running smoothly.\n\nExperimenting with a new dish during peak hours, however, becomes a significant challenge. The process of testing new recipes while maintaining the flow of regular orders often leads to disruptions in the kitchen, causing delays and dissatisfaction among customers.\n\nTo address this, the restaurant hires a kitchen manager. The kitchen manager creates a separate small kitchen dedicated to experimenting with new dishes. This ensures that the chefs can focus on their innovations without interfering with the ongoing operations. Once a dish is perfected, the kitchen manager introduces automation, such as using a conveyor belt, to streamline the cooking process. This allows the new dish to be produced efficiently alongside the existing menu items while ensuring there are no interruptions in serving food to the restaurant's customers.\n\nYes, DevOps engineers are none other than automation experts.\n\n#devops #devopsengineer #careerguidance  #newvlog  #trendingreels \n\nroles and responsibilities devops engineer\ndoes devops engineer need coding\nwhat is devops for beginners\nroles of a devops engineer\njob description of devops engineer\nrequirements for devops engineer\nskills required for devops engineer\ndefinition of devops engineer\n@Ajayhr_01",

        "videoDescription":"#DevOps has enabled digital transformation. In fifteen years, the way we engineer software has revolutionized. It\u2019s spread Continuous Integration and delivery across the globe, humanized IT culture, automated toil, and paying down technical debt. But it\u2019s nowhere near done. A lot of organizations have hit the ceiling. A wall. The brakes. Stagnated. The promise remains: We can thrive in the digital age, create joy through customer experiences, move fast, be nimble, outcompete, and achieve extraordinary organizational performance. But it needs unlocking. #ValueStreamManagement has hundreds of years of history, but its time is now. Building on everything we\u2019ve learned from DevOps, using the toolchains, pipelines, and rich data sources we\u2019ve created, combining VSM and DevOps means we can see organizations as value-generating enterprises. We can pinpoint the choke points, bottlenecks, and dependencies and quickly apply fixes to optimize flow and value realization.\n\nIn this talk, Helen Beal will share real stories from enterprises she\u2019s worked with on how they\u2019ve relentlessly pursued improvement using VSM and DevOps practices and the outcomes they\u2019ve seen.\n\n----\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nHelen Beal is CEO and Chair of the Value Stream Management Consortium and co-chair of the OASIS Value Stream Management Interoperability Technical Committee. She leads the ambassador program at PeopleCert for the DevOps Institute, ITIL, and PRINCE2. She is also Chair of the DevNetwork DevOps Advisory Board and provides strategic advisory services to DevOps and VSM industry leaders.\n\nHelen authorizes the VSMC's annual State of VSM Reports and Moogsoft's State of Availability Report. She is also a co-author of Investments Unlimited, a book about DevOps and governance published by IT Revolution. She is a DevOps editor for InfoQ and writes for many other online platforms.\n\nHelen hosts the Day-to-Day DevOps webinar series for BrightTalk and speaks on DevOps, AI, and value stream-related topics at industry conferences and corporate events.\n\nShe regularly appears in TechBeacon\u2019s DevOps Top100 lists, was recognized as the Top DevOps Evangelist 2020 in the DevOps Dozen awards, and was a finalist for Computing DevOps Excellence Awards\u2019 DevOps Professional of the Year 2021.\n\nShe serves on advisory and judging boards for many initiatives, including Developer Week, DevOps World, JAX DevOps, and InterOp.\n\n----\n\n\ud83d\udc47 Learn more:\nhttps:\/\/www.thedevopsconference.com\/copenhagen?utm_campaign=The%20DevOps%20Conference%20Scandinavia%202024&utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social&utm_content=youtube_link_copenhagen_2024\n\nIf you want to learn more about DevOps transformations, check out our page here:\nhttps:\/\/www.eficode.com\/devops-transformation\n----\n00:00 Intro\n02:37 Where are we with DevOps?\n13:18 History of VSM\n17:56 What is VSM?\n24:49 Lead time and cycle time\n26:20 Guide to VSM\n28:30 Two dimensions of VSM\n29:51 The Value Cycle\n31:25 The DevOps Toolchain\n39:35 Outro",

        "videoDescription":"This talk explains a balanced approach for a successful migration. A thorough understanding of the quirks of legacy applications is the foundation for a successful migration to more modern infrastructure in DevOps. However, this understanding cuts across various teams, not just the DevOps or SRE team. The security team has to perform a risk assessment, observability has to be in place by the SRE team, infrastructure compatibility, incremental migration strategy, Quality Assurance team needs to perform tests, and Documentation also has to be taken into account. Stakeholders - internal and external ones need to be carried along to manage expectations.\n\nThe approach of working across various teams ensures that all aspects of the migration process are addressed comprehensively, minimising risks and maximising the chances of success. Each team brings its expertise and perspective to the table, contributing to a well-rounded migration strategy. By involving all relevant teams and stakeholders from the outset, potential issues can be identified and addressed early on, leading to a smoother and more efficient migration process.",

        "videoDescription":"Dealing with any neuro-diversity is difficult and stigmatized, but lessons learned from DevOps and Complex Systems management have helped me improve how I handle situations. These lessons can be applied broadly and shift our thinking to how DevOps extends beyond tech alone. Mental illness is stigmatized and hard to talk about publicly. Doubly so in the tech industry where we assign much of our personal value to our brains. I want to share my struggles with mental health and the lessons I\u2019ve learned from Systems operation and DevOps that have helped me get by and frame my struggle in a manageable way.\n\nI want to start a conversation to:\n\n    Help reduce the stigma of Mental Illness by talking about it\n    Provide some illustration of things that have helped me, so hopefully they can help you\n    Show how the concepts of DevOps have application reaching beyond High Technology\n    Spark further conversation about Mental health in tech\n    Hopefully provide a new group and community for those for whom mental health is a concern",
