In this video, Liz and Seth discuss the differences and similarities between DevOps and SRE, ultimately realizing that DevOps and SRE aren't two competing methods, but rather close friends designed help break down organizational barriers to deliver better software faster. DevOps is like an abstract class in programming, and SRE is one possible implementation of that class.\n\nSite Reliability Engineering: https:\/\/goo.gl\/aCiiPV\nHow SRE relates to DevOps: https:\/\/goo.gl\/NWKuj9\nManaging Deployments with Kubernetes Engine Qwiklab: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2zdFQh5\n\nReach out to Liz and Seth:\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/sethvargo\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/lizthegrey\n\nWatch more episodes from the playlist here: https:\/\/goo.gl\/CKv3tV\nSubscribe to the Google Cloud Platform channel for more Cloud content: https:\/\/goo.gl\/S0AS51",

It has become a buzzword within days of its release and professionals in all fields, especially in high skilled areas like lawyers, doctors, engineers are questioning whether such AI can actually replace them and work.\n\nSo in this video I want to talk about what ChatGPT is and how it even popped up, talk a bit about the organization behind GPT called \"OpenAI\", which has already created many other machine learning models besides Chat GPT and also explain technically about all that.\nAnd then we'll dive in and actually put ChatGPT to use for some DevOps related tasks.\nI really want to see how it can help in generating configuration code for building DevOps processes or different parts of those processes and how well it knows different DevOps technologies, but not just some shallow examples or boilerplate code that I can get from official documentation, but instead also try more fine-tuning and small optimizations in that configuration code.\n\nWe're also going to check out an open source command line tool that is built on top of ChatGPT and was specifically created for engineers to generate infrastructure as code templates and more and finally we'll talk about the impact of ChatGPT, the quality and usefulness of such a tool for engineers and whether it will really replace the engineers and to what extent you should be concerned.\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac T I M E S T A M P S \u23f0  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n00:00 - Intro and Overview\n01:39 - What is ChatGPT, Who developed ChatGPT\n06:45 - Sign Up on ChatGPT\n09:23 - Create Dockerfile for Node.js app using ChatGPT\n22:13 - Create Kubernetes manifest file using ChatGPT\n35:06 - Create CI\/CD pipeline code using ChatGPT\n50:06 - Convert Jenkinsfile into GitLab CI config file\n53:53 - Tools built on top of OpenAI's API\n55:01 - AIaC demo - CLI tool for DevOps\n01:01:00 - My opinion on ChatGPT & whether ChatGPT will replace engineers\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Want to learn more? \ud83d\ude80  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nFull Python course                                            \u25ba  https:\/\/youtu.be\/t8pPdKYpowI\nFull Docker course                                            \u25ba  https:\/\/youtu.be\/3c-iBn73dDE\nFull K8s course                                                  \u25ba  https:\/\/youtu.be\/X48VuDVv0do\nDevOps Tools explained                                   \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/2W9UEq6\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Connect with me \ud83d\udc4b   \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nINSTAGRAM             \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/2F3LXYJ\nTWITTER                   \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/3i54PUB\nLINKEDIN                  \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/3hWOLVT\nFB group                   \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/32UVSZP\nDEV                            \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/3h2fqiO\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Courses & Ebooks & Bootcamp \ud83d\ude80      \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \n\u25ba Become a DevOps Engineer - full educational program             \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc   https:\/\/bit.ly\/45mXaer\n\u25ba High-Quality and Hands-On Courses                                             \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc   https:\/\/bit.ly\/3BNS8Kv\n\u25ba Kubernetes 101 - compact and easy-to-read ebook bundle      \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc   https:\/\/bit.ly\/3Ozl28x",

But there is a lot of mix up of these two roles and many people and many companies often use them interchangeably. They mix the tasks and responsibilities of these two very often. For example there are plenty of job descriptions for \"DevOps Cloud Engineer\" or \"Cloud DevOps Engineer\", which would naturally make you think that they are the same role, but then why would you have two names for the same role?

There is a lot of discussion going on, where some people are asking whether platform engineering replaces DevOps. Many people say it goes hand in hand and is rather an addition to DevOps, but in reality it's a bit more complicated than that. Platform engineering actually changes a lot of established rules we knew about DevOps, SRE and Cloud engineering, it changes the game and introduces some new rules.\n\nSo let's clearly define, what platform engineering exactly is, more interestingly, why was there even a need for this new role and how it evolved and of course how it compares to DevOps and Cloud engineering and does it really replace any of these roles?\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac T I M E S T A M P S \u23f0  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n0:00 - Intro and Overview\n0:50 - Why Platform Engineering?

In this video, we're sharing the top 5 DevOps certifications that are likely to be in high demand in 2023.\nDevOps certifications are one of the best ways to show hiring managers that you're qualified for a technical position. They're also a great way to set yourself up for more advanced career opportunities.\n\n\n\nIn this video we will cover the following topics:\n\n00:00 -  Introduction\n01:42 - Why Certifications are Important\n03:35 - Python Certification\n05:30 - Docker\n06:15 - Kubernetes\n08:22 - Terraform\n08:57 - Linux\n10:16 - Conclusion\n\nWant to view a clear path to becoming a DevOps Engineer? Visit our website - www.kodekloud.com\nWe have various Learning Paths to help you choose your next step and shape your DevOps Career. \n\nCheck out our learning paths at KodeKloud to get started:\n\n -Linux: https:\/\/bit.ly\/LinuxLearningPath\n- DevOps Learning Path: https:\/\/bit.ly\/DevOpsLearningPath-YT\n -Docker: https:\/\/bit.ly\/DockerLearningPath\n -Kubernetes: https:\/\/bit.ly\/KubernetesLearningPath\n -Infrastructure as Code(IAC): https:\/\/bit.ly\/IACLearningPath\n -Programming: https:\/\/bit.ly\/ProgrammingLearningPath\n\n \nThose new to the Programming and DevOps world often find it challenging to start their journey due to the missing basic prerequisites. For example, issues with setting up a basic lab environment using VirtualBox, problems with networking, or trouble with working with the Linux CLI or text editors like vi editor. Sometimes there are issues with applications - like getting a sample application to work, problems with getting the dependencies to install correctly or trouble with getting a web server to communicate with a database server. Or, at other times, it's working with data formats like JSON or YAML.\n\nSo we have identified a gap, and we believe that this is due to missing some of the basic prerequisites, such as knowing the basics of Linux, the basics of tools like VirtualBox, or knowing the basics of the most commonly used applications like Java, Python or NodeJS or web servers like Apache, NGINX etc. As a DevOps or Cloud Engineer, it is crucial to have these basics cleared. And that\u2019s why we are helping you to bridge that gap!\n\nFor more updates on courses and tips, follow us on:\n-Website: https:\/\/kodekloud.com\/\n-LinkedIn: https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/kode...\n-Twitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/kodekloud1\n-Facebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/kodekloudtra...\n-Instagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/kodekloud\/\n-Blog: https:\/\/kodekloud.com\/blog\/\n\n#itcertifications  #devopscertification #kodekloud",

        "videoDescription":"DevOps engineer and Cloud engineer have similar skills and responsibilities, but their role is pretty distinct. So in this video, we'll compare and contrast the roles of the DevOps engineer and the Cloud engineer, to help you decide which one is right for you. After watching this video, you'll know which one is the right fit for your needs! \n\n\n\nIn this video we will cover the following topics:\n\n00:00 -  Introduction\n01:14 - What is a DevOps Engineer?\n02:44 - What is a Cloud Engineer?\n04:12 - What's the Difference?\n04:42 - How are they valued?\n05:53 - Which one you should consider?\n06:45 - What salary can you expect?\n07:40 - Learning Paths\n\nWant to view a clear path to becoming a DevOps Engineer? Visit our website - https:\/\/bit.ly\/Kodekloud-YT\nWe have various Learning Paths to help you choose your next step and shape your DevOps Career. \n\nCheck out our learning paths at KodeKloud to get started:\n\n -Linux: https:\/\/bit.ly\/LinuxLearningPath\n- DevOps Learning Path: https:\/\/bit.ly\/DevOpsLearningPath-YT\n -Docker: https:\/\/bit.ly\/DockerLearningPath\n -Kubernetes: https:\/\/bit.ly\/KubernetesLearningPath\n -Infrastructure as Code(IAC): https:\/\/bit.ly\/IACLearningPath\n -Programming: https:\/\/bit.ly\/ProgrammingLearningPath\n\n \nThose new to the Programming and DevOps world often find it challenging to start their journey due to the missing basic prerequisites. For example, issues with setting up a basic lab environment using VirtualBox, problems with networking, or trouble with working with the Linux CLI or text editors like vi editor. Sometimes there are issues with applications - like getting a sample application to work, problems with getting the dependencies to install correctly or trouble with getting a web server to communicate with a database server. Or, at other times, it's working with data formats like JSON or YAML.\n\nSo we have identified a gap, and we believe that this is due to missing some of the basic prerequisites, such as knowing the basics of Linux, the basics of tools like VirtualBox, or knowing the basics of the most commonly used applications like Java, Python or NodeJS or web servers like Apache, NGINX etc. As a DevOps or Cloud Engineer, it is crucial to have these basics cleared. And that\u2019s why we are helping you to bridge that gap!\n\nFor more updates on courses and tips, follow us on:\n-Website: https:\/\/kodekloud.com\/\n-LinkedIn: https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/kode...\n-Twitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/kodekloud1\n-Facebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/kodekloudtra...\n-Instagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/kodekloud\/\n-Blog: https:\/\/kodekloud.com\/blog\/\n\n#devopsengineer   #cloudengineer  #kodekloud",

It keeps your Wi-Fi secure, hides your IP, and blocks those creepy trackers. Even if I\u2019m hacking away on free caf\u00e9 Wi-Fi, I know I\u2019m safe.\n\n\ud83d\udd11 Proton Pass https:\/\/go.getproton.me\/SH1dl - My password vault. Proper on-device encryption, 2FA codes, logins, secrets - all mine and only mine. No compromises.\n\nThese are partner links - you won\u2019t pay a cent more, but you\u2019ll be supporting DevOps Compass. Thanks a ton - it helps me keep this compass pointing the right way \ud83d\udc9c\n\n## Follow Me\n\n\ud83c\udfac YouTube https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCf85kQ0u1sYTTTyKVpxrlyQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83d\udc26 X \/ Twitter https:\/\/twitter.com\/heyvaldemar\n\ud83c\udfa8 Instagram https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/heyvaldemar\/\n\ud83d\udc18 Mastodon https:\/\/mastodon.social\/@heyvaldemar\n\ud83e\uddf5 Threads https:\/\/www.threads.net\/@heyvaldemar\n\ud83c\udfb8 Facebook https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/heyvaldemarFB\/\n\ud83e\udd8b Bluesky https:\/\/bsky.app\/profile\/heyvaldemar.com\n\ud83c\udfa5 TikTok https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@heyvaldemar\n\ud83d\udcbb LinkedIn https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/heyvaldemar\/\n\ud83d\udce3 daily.dev Squad https:\/\/app.daily.dev\/squads\/devopscompass\n\u2708\ufe0f Telegram https:\/\/t.me\/heyvaldemar\n\ud83d\udc08 GitHub https:\/\/github.com\/heyvaldemar\n\n## Community of IT Experts\n\n\ud83d\udc7e Discord https:\/\/discord.gg\/AJQGCCBcqf\n\n## Refill My Coffee Supplies\n\n\ud83d\udc96 PayPal https:\/\/www.paypal.com\/paypalme\/heyvaldemarcom\n\ud83c\udfc6 Patreon https:\/\/www.patreon.com\/heyvaldemar\n\ud83d\udc8e GitHub https:\/\/github.com\/sponsors\/heyvaldemar\n\ud83e\udd64 BuyMeaCoffee https:\/\/www.buymeacoffee.com\/heyvaldemar\n\ud83c\udf6a Ko-fi https:\/\/ko-fi.com\/heyvaldemar\n\u26a1 Telegram Boost https:\/\/t.me\/heyvaldemar?boost\n\n\ud83c\udf1f Bitcoin (BTC): bc1q2fq0k2lvdythdrj4ep20metjwnjuf7wccpckxc\n\ud83d\udd39 Ethereum (ETH): 0x76C936F9366Fad39769CA5285b0Af1d975adacB8\n\ud83e\ude99 Binance Coin (BNB): bnb1xnn6gg63lr2dgufngfr0lkq39kz8qltjt2v2g6\n\ud83d\udca0 Litecoin (LTC): LMGrhx8Jsx73h1pWY9FE8GB46nBytjvz8g\n\n#DevOps #CloudComputing #Kubernetes #GitOps #DevOpsTools #AIinDevOps #CICD #CloudSecurity #Automation",

A decade of engineering helps in systems thinking and product building. Learning about Strategy, Marketing, People Management, and Finance on the go. \n\nWhat am I building? Today, 25 million Indians prepare for government job entrance exams. They do it for years together. The probability of success is less than 1% but they still do it. Why? For the lack of a structured alternative to launch their white-collar career. I am building Invact to bridge this gap. \nHow? Follow me to know, it's a long story.

        "videoDescription":"DevOps Engineer Cherwin Nooitmeer on the complexity of Kubernetes and the future of DevOps.\n\n\u201cThe future of DevOps is going to be boring\u201d\n\nWhat is DevOps?\nThere are programmers that write software that need to run on computers, we call them servers. And when a programmer writes software, someone needs to put that software on the computers. So people like you and me can access facebook.com and see pictures of cats. Right?\n\nThe process from getting the software from a developer to one of the computers that Facebook has, because you can imagine, they have a lot of them. How you do that, that is where DevOps comes in.\n\nSo you write software and you have to put it in production. The gap in between, that's where my focus is. And I try to reduce that gap, so it's instant basically.\n\nWhy DevOps?\nCompanies have started to realize, if you have good DevOps processes you can deliver value to the customer faster. You can just outperform all competitors.\n\nWhat\u2019s the future of DevOps?\nThe future of DevOps, I hope, from my perspective, is going to be boring. DevOps will develop and become more mature. We will get better tools and better ways of doing things, like testing and doing infrastructure in a way that is reliable and fast. Hopefully, my job will be as a commodity so I can work on other things and add even more value to customers.\n\nWhat is Kubernetes?\nSo what we need to do is to make sure we can run software, that we can update it, roll back things, etcetera. These are similar things that every company needs to do.\n\nSo Google came and they basically understood and standardized the way of rolling out software and deploying it to users, making sure everything works fine. They basically extracted their learnings into a product. And that product is Kubernetes. People like I use Kubernetes to build platforms so we can enable companies to deliver value to customers faster.\n\nWhat I do think about Kubernetes is that when people see it, they see it\u2019s awesome and they all try to use it. I think that's a mistake.\n\nIs the hype real?\nThere\u2019s a lot of hype around Kubernetes. But Kubernetes also adds a lot of complexity. And I think the complexity gets overshadowed by the hype. People think it\u2019s fine and it just works and you can use it.\n\nBut what I do think, this complexity that is there is necessary. Because if you are not going to use the complexity of Kubernetes, you are going to create your own system that you need to maintain and develop. Because it's not only software that we use to service users. You also need to write software to service the servers, if that makes any sense. Right?\n\nAnd if you are going to write it yourself. What happens if you hire a new guy? Now you have to explain to the new guy how your complexity works. So instead of using a complexity that everyone knows, you\u2019re going to create your own complexity. And now you have to teach everybody about your own complexity. And then you need to maintain it.\n\nSo this is a trade-off, what are you going to do? I mean, if you have a very simple problem and can get away with having less complexity. Then maybe Kubernetes is not the right thing for you.\n\nCoder Society is a professional community of senior freelance developers, designers, and product managers.\n\nJoin our journey: https:\/\/codersociety.com\n#Kubernetes #k8s #DevOps",

        "videoDescription":"This video captures my presentation delivered at the DevOps Meetup in Z\u00fcrich on January 25, 2024, where I delve into the prevalent challenges faced by traditional DevOps methodologies, characterized by isolated teams and fragmented value streams that impede efficiency. It explores DevOps as a holistic culture, mindset, and suite of technical practices designed to foster continuous value delivery, prioritize products over projects, and focus on customer-centric development. Additionally, I introduce Platform Engineering as a strategic evolution of DevOps aimed at mitigating the technical and operational complexities encountered when scaling DevOps in larger enterprises. Highlighting a collaborative project with LGT and Z\u00fchlke, I present the Platform Plane case study, demonstrating how an internal developer platform can streamline and standardize DevOps processes across various teams, thereby reducing cognitive load and enhancing productivity. This presentation goes beyond theoretical discussion, offering a hands-on demonstration of the Platform Plane and its functionalities, including Kubernetes as a service, API gateway, and Service Mesh, among others. It illustrates the vital role of Platform Engineering in enabling product teams to adopt DevOps more efficiently and effectively, leading to an optimized development lifecycle.\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac T I M E S T A M P S \u23f0  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n00:00 Intro\n00:08 Welcome\n00:31 About me\n02:36 Today's challenges\n04:33 DevOps is here to help\n05:20 Who is DevOps?\n06:44 The Benefit of DevOps\n08:05 DevOps is bullshit?\n08:27 What are the Challenges with DevOps?\n08:59 You build it you run it\n10:18 Think about that on scale.\n11:06 Can you scale DevOps?\n11:23 Example of What companies want\n15:50 The Digital Factory \n16:35 Platform Engineering Enables DevOps in Product Teams.\n18:30 The Gartner Top Strategic Technology Trends for 2024. \n19:29 Platform Engineering Improves DevOps Efficiency.\n20:24 The Platform Plane: Big Picture.\n22:04 The Platform Plane: High Level Architecture\n21:56 Demo 1 - The Admin Areas\n25:56 Demo 2 - Platform Plane\n26:01 Platform Plane- Main page\n26:27 Documentations\n27:38 AI Assistant\n29:21 Platform plane:\n30:12 - GitLab\n30:44 - Repositories \n32:13 - Registry\n33:40 - Package Management\n36:42 - Hypervisor ( virtual machines)\n36:52 - Identity \n37:56- Chat\n39:07 Summary\n39:45 Outro\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac  L I N K S  \ud83d\udd17\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nPlatform Plane: \n\u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/rSUI6-R4DlM\n\nLGT: \n\u27a4 https:\/\/www.lgt.com\/\n\nZ\u00fchlke: \n\u27a4 https:\/\/www.zuehlke.com\/\n\nDevOps Meetup Z\u00fcrich: \n\u27a4 https:\/\/www.meetup.com\/devops-meetup-zurich\/\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Want to learn more? \ud83d\ude80  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \n\nYou're developing products, not projects \n\u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/ImbhUFr6suw?si=UeSOAR67hZcJWE5T\n\nDevOps \n\u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/Ath3XoLbYxY?si=xzJzs4Fqpst6uxqm\n\nApply continous testing and build-in quality \n\u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/W0QZRpf7ElM?si=oe54rFG0uEXtHUbJ\n\nApply continous security \n\u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/340YmM08Eb0?si=QFOGkCnUElDXevR-\n\nBuild a platform\n \u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/UE8mSt55xHw?si=cc6_S_6Wv6iwA_y1\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac  S U B S C R I B E  \ud83d\udd14 \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \n\u2554\u2550\u2566\u2557\u2554\u2566\u2557\u2554\u2550\u2566\u2550\u2566\u2566\u2566\u2566\u2557\u2554\u2550\u2557\n\u2551\u255a\u2563\u2551\u2551\u2551\u255a\u2563\u255a\u2563\u2554\u2563\u2554\u2563\u2551\u255a\u2563\u2550\u2563\n\u2560\u2557\u2551\u255a\u255d\u2551\u2551\u2560\u2557\u2551\u255a\u2563\u2551\u2551\u2551\u2551\u2551\u2550\u2563\n\u255a\u2550\u2569\u2550\u2550\u2569\u2550\u2569\u2550\u2569\u2550\u2569\u255d\u255a\u2569\u2550\u2569\u2550\u255d\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCXvlc9x4zlv5DEqbby55Ivg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Connect with me \ud83d\udc4b  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nLINKEDIN                  \u25ba https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/romanoroth\/\nTWITTER                   \u25ba https:\/\/twitter.com\/RomanoRoth\nINSTAGRAM             \u25ba https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/romanoroth\/\nFACEBOOK               \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/romanoroth\/\nMEETUP                   \u25ba https:\/\/www.meetup.com\/de-DE\/DevOps-Meetup-Zurich\/\nCONFERNCE            \u25bahttps:\/\/www.devopsdays.ch\/\nHOMEPAGE              \u25ba  https:\/\/www.romanoroth.com\/\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac  P L A Y L I S T S  \u25b6\ufe0f \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nModern Software Engineering\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLrsbMazVPK_rb56rZQr2fyBGR3cyanZpX\nDevOps\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLrsbMazVPK_ro3fn1G-3Ui2mBPHxOD9kF\nGitLab: Build a DevSecOps Pipeline\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLrsbMazVPK_qhf3ahA_zRPlwBaGGhSu2P\n\n#devsecops  #devops #romanoroth #platformengineering",

        "videoDescription":"Dive into the transformative world of DevOps in the embedded industry with me. This video brings to life my presentation from the DevOps Meetup in Munich on November 15, 2023, offering a deep dive into the evolution of software development methodologies and the pivotal role of DevOps in driving innovation.\n\nEmbark on a journey from the constrained waterfall methodologies to the agile landscape, where a product-centric approach addresses real customer needs. Discover the challenges that plague the industry, from legacy systems and budget constraints to the \"wall of confusion\" that disrupts effective collaboration. More than a strategy to overcome these hurdles, DevOps emerges as a culture of collaboration, inclusivity, and continuous improvement.\n\nExperience the power of DevOps through the success stories of industry giants like Tesla and SpaceX, illustrating how Agile and DevOps principles can elevate a company's market position. Gain insights into the essential capabilities for enhancing software delivery performance, inspired by the seminal book \"Accelerate.\"\n\nLearn about the critical role of Platform Engineering and the Digital Factory model in embedding DevOps practices within product teams. This innovative approach not only simplifies the development process but also ensures consistency and fosters an environment ripe for continuous value delivery and breakthrough innovation.\n\nJoin me in this exploration of DevOps' potential to revolutionize the embedded industry, paving the way for future advancements.

SSH or Secure Shell is a cryptographic network protocol designed for secure data communication. It is often used in passwordless authentication scenarios, improving the productivity and security of developers.\n\nWorking with Azure DevOps, an all-inclusive suite of development tools provided by Microsoft, can be significantly enhanced by using SSH. Azure DevOps comprises various services including Azure Repos, which is a set of version control tools that help developers manage their code. Azure Repos is versatile in that it supports both Git and Team Foundation Version Control.\n\nOne of the ways to interact with Azure Repos is using Git, a popular open-source version control system. When using Git with Azure Repos, developers have the flexibility to work with their codebase using various Git clients, including the popular VS Code. However, to establish a secure connection between these clients and Azure Repos, proper authentication is crucial.\n\nThis is where SSH comes in. Using SSH, you can authenticate to Azure DevOps, and particularly, Azure Git Repositories, without entering your username and password every time. This not only saves time but also minimizes the risk of your credentials being exposed.\n\nThis guide aims to help developers configure SSH for Azure DevOps, understand how to clone Azure Git Repos using SSH, and embrace passwordless and public key authentication methods for seamless and secure operations. Whether you're an IT professional, software engineer, or someone interested in learning about DevOps, this information will equip you with valuable insights into SSH integration and usage.\n\nThis video is about:-\nSSH Authentication\nAzure DevOps Tutorials\nAzure Repos\nAzure Git Repositories \nVS Code with Azure DevOps\nGit Authentication\nClone Azure Git Repo with SSH\nHow to use SSH authentication with Azure DevOps \nSsh passwordless authentication\nSsh with public key authentication \nUsing SSH to authenticate Git in Azure DevOps\nClone git Repository using SSH in Azure DevOps\n\n#AzureDevOps #git #softwareengineering",

        "videoDescription":"All you will get information in this Video: https:\/\/youtu.be\/DBQLl360Mz0\n\nPurpose of Parallel Jobs: The video explains how to enable parallel jobs in Azure DevOps, which is necessary for running CI\/CD pipelines.\n\nCreating a Project: Start by creating a project within your Azure DevOps organization, noting your organization URL.\n\nAccess Billing Settings: Navigate to the organization settings, select \"Billing,\" and locate the option for parallel jobs.\n\nParallel Jobs Availability: Initially, new organizations have zero parallel jobs available, preventing pipeline execution until jobs are enabled.\n\nRequesting Parallel Jobs: Users must request parallel jobs through a specific URL provided by Microsoft, as they no longer provide them by default due to past misuse.\n\nMisuse Prevention: Microsoft stopped offering free parallel jobs by default because users exploited them for unauthorized activities like Bitcoin mining.\n\nRequest Process: Fill out the form with your name, the same email ID used for Azure DevOps, and your organization URL. Request only private parallel jobs unless you have a valid reason for public jobs.\n\nApproval Timeframe: It typically takes 24 to 48 hours for Microsoft to approve parallel job requests.\n\nVerification: After approval, you can verify the availability of parallel jobs in the Azure DevOps portal under the \"Parallel Jobs\" section in the billing settings.\n\nBilling Setup for Additional Jobs: For additional parallel jobs, users need an active Azure subscription (e.g., Pay-As-You-Go), and setup billing, linking it to the Azure subscription. This will allow for purchasing more parallel jobs if needed.\n\n\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83c\udfeb This complete tutorial is compiled by Sandeep Soni, a Microsoft Certified Trainer, a Software & Corporate Trainer for 27years!  \nFor more Training Courses Visit: https:\/\/www.bestitcourses.com\n\n\ud83d\udcf2 \ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf0\ud835\ude01 \ud835\ude04\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf5 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff\ud83d\udc4b \nCall Sandeep Soni for Career Guidance \u25ba +91 98490 01840 \nConnect with me on LINKEDIN \u25ba https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/sandeepsoni123\/ \n \n\ud83d\udc4d \ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb'\ud835\ude01 \ud835\uddd9\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf4\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude01 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddfc \n- Like the video if you found it helpful. \n- Subscribe to our channel for more DevOps tutorials and certification guides. \n- Hit the bell icon to get notified of our latest videos. \n\n\ud83d\udcac Join the Conversation \nHave questions or need further clarification?

        "videoDescription":"Start your DevOps Career (Beginners - Advanced) - https:\/\/bit.ly\/DevOpsLearningPath-YT\n\nDevOps is a buzzword. It\u2019s huge right now in the tech community, and it\u2019s definitely becoming more central to how teams build software.\nIf you\u2019re starting with DevOps, this video will help you understand the basics and give you a good head-start on your journey. You will also learn about the different stages in DevOps, what tools are needed at each stage, and how potential problems should be handled.\n\nStart your DevOps Career (Beginners - Advanced) - https:\/\/bit.ly\/DevOpsLearningPath-YT\n\nIn this video we will cover the following topics:\n\n00:00 -  Introduction\n00:27 - Problems before DevOps\n01:33 - Two Stages of DevOps\n02:12 - Real World Scenario 1\n03:28 - Real World Scenario 2\n04:12 - Automation\n05:06 - Benefits of DevOps\n06:10 - Summary\n07:22 - Conclusion\n \nThose new to the Programming and DevOps world often find it challenging to start their journey due to the missing basic prerequisites. For example, issues with setting up a basic lab environment using VirtualBox, problems with networking, or trouble with working with the Linux CLI or text editors like vi editor. Sometimes there are issues with applications - like getting a sample application to work, problems with getting the dependencies to install correctly or trouble with getting a web server to communicate with a database server. Or, at other times, it's working with data formats like JSON or YAML.\n\nSo we have identified a gap, and we believe that this is due to missing some of the basic prerequisites, such as knowing the basics of Linux, the basics of tools like VirtualBox, or knowing the basics of the most commonly used applications like Java, Python or NodeJS or web servers like Apache, NGINX etc. As a DevOps or Cloud Engineer, it is crucial to have these basics cleared. And that\u2019s why we are helping you to bridge that gap!\n\nWant to view a clear path to becoming a DevOps Engineer?

The dbForge SQL Complete is a powerful IntelliSense-style SQL completion, code refactoring, code formatting tool for SQL Server. SQL Complete is available as an add-in for Visual Studio and SQL Server Management Studio.\n\n\u2139\ufe0f In the automated CI process, SQL Complete serves as a means to format update or database creation scripts before they get into a NuGet package.\nWhen database development is in the hot phase, developers often tend to forget about formatting a script before sending the UPDATE scripts to source control (Git) or use different formatting tools with inconsistent settings.\n\nAs a result, the script formatting in NuGet looks like a mess that has nothing in common with the corporate code formatting standards.\ndbForge SQL Complete is a robust tool which can help developers write and format code while saving time on these processes.\n\nCheck more useful information: \n\ud83d\udd25 How SQL Complete is involved in the DevOps process here:\nhttps:\/\/www.devart.com\/dbforge\/sql\/database-devops\/sqlcomplete.html\n\n\ud83d\udd25 DevOps Automation is a part of SQL Tools:\nhttps:\/\/www.devart.com\/dbforge\/sql\/database-devops\/download.html\n\n\u2705 Subscribe to our channel\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/DevartSoftware\/  \n\n#SQLComplete #SQL #DevOps #SQLDatabase #dbForge #Devart",

The main focus will be on the new Azure Managed DevOps Agent Pools, what they are, how they work, and why you might want to use them.\n\nWe\u2019ll start by deploying some prerequisites using Terraform, including a virtual network to host our agents. You\u2019ll see how to use the AzAPI provider to get the job done and I\u2019ll walk you through it all, step by step, as we build this Terraform project from scratch.\n\nOnce everything is up and running, we\u2019ll connect our agent to an Azure Pipeline and run a deployment to test it out.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to automate Azure DevOps agent pool provisioning with Terraform and AzAPI, or just want to learn more about CI\/CD in Azure, you\u2019re in the right place. Hope you enjoy the video!\n\nTimestamps: \n0:00 Intro\n1:00 Differences between managed devops pools and other offerings\n3:40 Comparison table between VMSS and Managed Devops Pool\n5:40 Writing our Terraform code\n27:50 Writing Terraform for our Managed Devops pool\n33:30 Deploying our code\n34:10 Create pipelines and test our pool\n38:20 Recap and outro\n\nLinks to learn documentation: \nhttps:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/devops\/pipelines\/agents\/agents?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml%2Cbrowser\nhttps:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/devops\/managed-devops-pools\/migrate-from-scale-set-agents?view=azure-devops\n\n\u2615\ufe0f Want to buy me a coffee? https:\/\/ko-fi.com\/lindbergtech\nOnly if you want to, of course\n\n\nSocials:\nLinkedIn:  https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/carl-lindberg-a7b76a175\/\nGithub: https:\/\/github.com\/carlzxc71\n\n#terraform #azure #microsoft #cloud #iac",

OPA provides a high-level declarative language that lets us specify policies as code and simple APIs to offload policy decision-making from our software. We can use OPA to enforce policies in microservices, Kubernetes, CI\/CD pipelines, API gateways, and more. \nIn kubernetes, OPA uses admission controllers.\n\nWhat is OPA Gatekeeper?\n\nOPA Gatekeeper is a specialized project providing first-class integration between OPA and Kubernetes.\nOPA Gatekeeper adds the following on top of plain OPA:\n\u25cf An extensible, parameterized policy library.\n\u25cf Native Kubernetes CRDs for instantiating the policy library (aka \u201cconstraints\u201d).\n\u25cf Native Kubernetes CRDs for extending the policy library (aka \u201cconstraint templates\u201d).\n\u25cf Audit functionality.\n\nWhy you need Gatekeeper?\n\nAs a Platform DevOps engineer managing multiple Kubernetes clusters for various projects, you face challenges when users deploy applications without adhering to best practices. Key issues include:\n  1.     Lack of ownership unless users apply labels themselves.\n  2.     No resource limits, leading to high costs.\n  3.     Untrusted images impacting other applications.\n  4.     Security and best practice violations across clusters.\n\nTo address these, we need governance to enforce limits and rules via policies. OPA Gatekeeper can be configured to implement these policies, ensuring best practices are followed.\n\nFollow my mentors too : @PavanElthepu    @MPrashant   @GouravSharma   @cloudwithraj   @AntonPutra   @AbhishekVeeramalla   @kubesimplify   @kshindi   @DevOpsJourney \n\nTags : #prometheus   #secrets #docker  #k8s #kubernetes #cncf #rbac #serverless #grafana #autoscaling #deployment  #opensource #devops #grafana #vault #terraform #kustomize #etcd #controlplane #container #opa #dockerhub #gatekeeper",

It's distributed so people around the world can share code\n2. It does version control\n\nSo, with version control, you can take snapshots of the state of your current code and maintain a history.\n\nBranching is really the third thing. Git branches allow developers to do isolated development and take chances without messing up the main branch.\n\nSo when someone asks me 'What is Git?', that is how I typically respond.",

My main agenda with this initiative is to build a testing mindset among students, as I believe that this is a crucial skill in today's software development landscape. By targeting those from less privileged backgrounds and areas, I hope to bridge the gap in knowledge and exposure to this field, opening up new opportunities for growth and development.  Through the use of podcasts.\n\u2728 Hashtags \u2728\n\n#salesforcetestingguy #SalesforceTesting\n#podcast #Testing#Respect #QualityAssurance #NotMoreSecondChoice #keepsupporting #keepsupporting #nothingisimpossible #podcast #interviews #placement #respect #automation \n#like #share #newyear #newlearnings #interviews #nothingisimpossible #placement #qualityassurance #quality #testingvideo #newinitiative #upload #uploads #download #shortvideo #videos #socialmedia #recommendations #keepsupporting #default #bestpratices \n#endscreen #youtube #contentcreator #valueadditioner #India #saleforcetestingguy #testinginsalesforce #guysalesforcetesting #testingguysalesforce #qualityassuranceguy #testingversusquality #responsibility #respect #SFDCQA (SFDC stands for Salesforce Dot Com)\n#SalesforceTestAutomation#SalesforceTestStrategy #SalesforceRegressionTesting #SalesforcePerformanceTesting\n#SalesforceDataMigrationTesting #SalesforceIntegrationTesting\n#SalesforceUserAcceptanceTesting #SalesforceSecurityTesting\n#SalesforceCodeCoverage #SalesforceTestReports\n#SalesforceTestFrameworks #SalesforceTestEnvironment\n#SFDCTesting#SalesforceQA#TestAutomation#SalesforceTester#TestingInSalesforce#QAEngineer#CodeTesting#TestAutomationInSFDC#SalesforceQuality#SFDCQualityAssurance#ReleaseTesting#ApexTesting#SalesforceDevOps#TestScripts#SFDCTestCases#RegressionTesting#SalesforcePerformanceTesting#ContinuousTesting#CodeQuality",

        "videoDescription":"Have you heart the terms Git plumbing and Git Porcelain?\n\nEver wondered what the different between Git porcelain vs plumbing was?\n\nFor the most part, the porcelain is the most commonly used Git files such as:\n\n- git init\n- git add\n- git commit\n- git revert\n- git merge\n- git rebase\n- git reset\n\nThat's the Git porcelain, and you won't get your hands too dirty when you touch it.\n\nThe Git plumbing? That's typically the config stuff in the hidden .git folder, including things like:\n\n- Refspec\n-Packfiles\n- The HEAD Pointer\n- Git References\n- Remote References\n- Transfer Protocols\n- Garbage Collector\n- Recovery files\n- Tree Objects\n- Environment variables\n\nHopefully you don't have to get your hands dirty with the Git plumbing too often. It's nice to stick with the Git porcelain.\n\nBut at the same time, plumbers do make a lot of money!",

        "videoDescription":"Docker volumes are essential tools for managing persistent data in Docker containers. Unlike container file systems, which are ephemeral and can be deleted when a container stops, volumes provide a way to save data independently from the lifecycle of containers.\n\nWhen you create a Docker volume, you're essentially setting up a dedicated storage space that can be shared among multiple containers. This is crucial for applications like databases where data integrity needs to be maintained even if the database container crashes or is updated.\n\nIn this tutorial about Docker volumes, we will delve into various concepts such as how to create and manage these volumes using Docker commands and Docker Compose. You'll learn how to mount volumes into your containers, enabling them to access stored data seamlessly.\n\nAdditionally, we'll explore different types of Docker volumes and their specific uses\u2014such as named volumes and bind mounts. Understanding these distinctions will enhance your ability to manage data effectively within your applications.\n\nIf you're new to Docker, this comprehensive guide will help you grasp the foundational principles of volume management while providing practical docker in Telugu for better understanding. Whether you're looking at persistent storage options or just trying to understand what Docker is all about, mastering docker volumes is a fundamental step. \n\nJoin us as we navigate through the essentials of using Docker volumes, ensuring your applications have reliable access to necessary data without complications!\n\nSubscribe to Tech Savvy Ops for more DevOps tutorials in Telugu.",

Their job includes coming up with innovative recipes, testing them, and adding the successful ones to the menu. At the same time, they also prepare food to meet the regular demand of customers who visit the restaurant daily. This dual responsibility of innovation and ongoing service can become overwhelming, especially during busy hours when the kitchen is already at full capacity.\n\nWait staff, on the other hand, focus on delivering the prepared food to customers. Their primary role is to ensure that the food reaches the diners promptly and in perfect condition, keeping the restaurant\u2019s operations running smoothly.\n\nExperimenting with a new dish during peak hours, however, becomes a significant challenge. The process of testing new recipes while maintaining the flow of regular orders often leads to disruptions in the kitchen, causing delays and dissatisfaction among customers.\n\nTo address this, the restaurant hires a kitchen manager. The kitchen manager creates a separate small kitchen dedicated to experimenting with new dishes. This ensures that the chefs can focus on their innovations without interfering with the ongoing operations. Once a dish is perfected, the kitchen manager introduces automation, such as using a conveyor belt, to streamline the cooking process. This allows the new dish to be produced efficiently alongside the existing menu items while ensuring there are no interruptions in serving food to the restaurant's customers.\n\nYes, DevOps engineers are none other than automation experts.\n\n#devops #devopsengineer #careerguidance  #newvlog  #trendingreels \n\nroles and responsibilities devops engineer\ndoes devops engineer need coding\nwhat is devops for beginners\nroles of a devops engineer\njob description of devops engineer\nrequirements for devops engineer\nskills required for devops engineer\ndefinition of devops engineer\n@Ajayhr_01",

HELLO WORLD?  \nCan anybody hear me behind the firewall...?  \n404 soul not found...\n\n(Verse 1) \nPush to prod at 3 A.M.,  \nBrain\u2019s a loop in mayhem,  \nTold myself \u201cjust one more line,\u201d  \nNow it\u2019s been seven sprints of crime.  \n\nGIT RESET --HARD!!\n\nDon\u2019t forget to update your dependencies...  \nYou wrote that logic at 2 A.M... it's trash...  \nKevin force-pushed again...\n\nYou ever deploy a microservice and pray it doesn\u2019t become a macro-disaster?  \nMy Docker container\u2019s the only thing holding me together.  \nI tried therapy once... then Jira assigned me 14 more tickets.  \nMy manager said: \u201cJust estimate in story points.\u201d  \nI said: haa\n\n(Chorus)\nHello world, hello pain,  \nIs this loop recursive or am I insane?  \nFrom Python dreams to Java screams,  \nMy RAM is low... and so are my hopes.\n\nAgile... agile... agile...  \nDeliverable... agile...\n\n(Verse 2) \nNull pointer stabbed me in the back,  \nKubernetes launched a DDoS attack.  \nStack Overflow won\u2019t answer me,  \nEven GPT said: \u201cYo bro, I\u2019d flee.\u201d\n\nBUILD FAILED!!!\n\n(Bridge)\nOne commit to rule them all...  \nOne Slack ping begins my fall...  \nYou're on-call this weekend... forever...\n\nDid you test it?  \nIt works on my machine!  \nKevin deleted the prod DB!  \nWhy is prod even accessible from the dashboard?!  \nHugOps... HugOps... HugOps...\n\nHow did I become this...?  \nI just wanted to build an app that makes cat noises...\n\n(Final Chorus)\nOhhhh HELLO WOOORLD, my sanity\u2019s gone,  \nThese tickets keep respawning at dawn.  \nManager says we\u2019re agile and fast,  \nBut this sprint\u2019s a dumpster fire blast.\n\nNOT ON PROOOOOOD!!\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n\ud83d\udd14 Like what you hear?

        "videoDescription":"#DevOps has enabled digital transformation. In fifteen years, the way we engineer software has revolutionized. It\u2019s spread Continuous Integration and delivery across the globe, humanized IT culture, automated toil, and paying down technical debt. But it\u2019s nowhere near done. A lot of organizations have hit the ceiling. A wall. The brakes. Stagnated. The promise remains: We can thrive in the digital age, create joy through customer experiences, move fast, be nimble, outcompete, and achieve extraordinary organizational performance. But it needs unlocking. #ValueStreamManagement has hundreds of years of history, but its time is now. Building on everything we\u2019ve learned from DevOps, using the toolchains, pipelines, and rich data sources we\u2019ve created, combining VSM and DevOps means we can see organizations as value-generating enterprises. We can pinpoint the choke points, bottlenecks, and dependencies and quickly apply fixes to optimize flow and value realization.\n\nIn this talk, Helen Beal will share real stories from enterprises she\u2019s worked with on how they\u2019ve relentlessly pursued improvement using VSM and DevOps practices and the outcomes they\u2019ve seen.\n\n----\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nHelen Beal is CEO and Chair of the Value Stream Management Consortium and co-chair of the OASIS Value Stream Management Interoperability Technical Committee. She leads the ambassador program at PeopleCert for the DevOps Institute, ITIL, and PRINCE2. She is also Chair of the DevNetwork DevOps Advisory Board and provides strategic advisory services to DevOps and VSM industry leaders.\n\nHelen authorizes the VSMC's annual State of VSM Reports and Moogsoft's State of Availability Report. She is also a co-author of Investments Unlimited, a book about DevOps and governance published by IT Revolution. She is a DevOps editor for InfoQ and writes for many other online platforms.\n\nHelen hosts the Day-to-Day DevOps webinar series for BrightTalk and speaks on DevOps, AI, and value stream-related topics at industry conferences and corporate events.\n\nShe regularly appears in TechBeacon\u2019s DevOps Top100 lists, was recognized as the Top DevOps Evangelist 2020 in the DevOps Dozen awards, and was a finalist for Computing DevOps Excellence Awards\u2019 DevOps Professional of the Year 2021.\n\nShe serves on advisory and judging boards for many initiatives, including Developer Week, DevOps World, JAX DevOps, and InterOp.\n\n----\n\n\ud83d\udc47 Learn more:\nhttps:\/\/www.thedevopsconference.com\/copenhagen?utm_campaign=The%20DevOps%20Conference%20Scandinavia%202024&utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social&utm_content=youtube_link_copenhagen_2024\n\nIf you want to learn more about DevOps transformations, check out our page here:\nhttps:\/\/www.eficode.com\/devops-transformation\n----\n00:00 Intro\n02:37 Where are we with DevOps?\n13:18 History of VSM\n17:56 What is VSM?\n24:49 Lead time and cycle time\n26:20 Guide to VSM\n28:30 Two dimensions of VSM\n29:51 The Value Cycle\n31:25 The DevOps Toolchain\n39:35 Outro",

        "videoDescription":"Eli's talk at DevOpsDays Raleigh focused on automating license checks in CI\/CD pipelines. Of course, the topic of open source licenses is fascinating to the All Things Open community and we wanted to learn more. During this interview, we talked with Eli about the importance of open source licensing, in particular, how they are automating license enforcement. Then we discussed some trends in DevOps from the perspective of a former DevOps engineer and manager.\n\nRegistration for All Things Open 2024 is now open. Register now to save your spot: https:\/\/allthingsopen.org\/ato-registration-now-open\n\n0:00 - Introduction\n0:08 - Welcome Eli Birger\n0:40 - Tell us about yourself\n2:10 - Can you share a few key takeaways that you shared with the audience here? \n3:28 - Why are open source licenses important?\n4:16 - What's happening in DevOps, a topic, a trend, a debate, that people should be aware of?\n5:09 - What's one piece of advice that you want to share with the All Things Open community?\n\nKey takeaways:\n* We publicly share  the CI\/CD enforcement we built for different types of licenses\n* The topic of open source licenses is very complex and very boring\n* The volume of licenses complicates the space\n* Be aware of \"blind spots\" in your processes and methodology\n* Do not take things for granted and challenge everything\n* Invest at least one hour a day for learning and challenging things\n\n###\nAbout Eli Birger \nEli is a passionate technologist with a background in telecom, cyber, and storage.

        "videoDescription":"This talk explains a balanced approach for a successful migration. A thorough understanding of the quirks of legacy applications is the foundation for a successful migration to more modern infrastructure in DevOps. However, this understanding cuts across various teams, not just the DevOps or SRE team. The security team has to perform a risk assessment, observability has to be in place by the SRE team, infrastructure compatibility, incremental migration strategy, Quality Assurance team needs to perform tests, and Documentation also has to be taken into account. Stakeholders - internal and external ones need to be carried along to manage expectations.\n\nThe approach of working across various teams ensures that all aspects of the migration process are addressed comprehensively, minimising risks and maximising the chances of success. Each team brings its expertise and perspective to the table, contributing to a well-rounded migration strategy. By involving all relevant teams and stakeholders from the outset, potential issues can be identified and addressed early on, leading to a smoother and more efficient migration process.",

In this episode of AppDevANGLE, Paul Nashawaty, Principal Analyst at theCUBE Research, sits down with Naveen Kumar, Founder and CEO of Truxt.ai, to explore how artificial intelligence is reshaping DevOps analytics, software development lifecycles (SDLC), and business decision-making at scale.\nAccording to theCUBE Research, organizations that embed AI into their analytics workflows are twice as likely to report significant value from their data initiatives. Truxt.ai is built to capitalize on that insight by automating analysis, surfacing actionable DevOps intelligence, and closing the feedback loop between development and business KPIs.\nIn this episode, you\u2019ll learn:\nWhy DORA metrics aren\u2019t enough\u2014and how Truxt.ai uncovers the why, not just the what\n\n\nHow to use agentic AI to reduce reliance on manual analysis and accelerate decision-making\n\n\nHow to streamline CI\/CD pipelines and standardize toolchains across large enterprises\n\n\nWhy AI improves DevOps consistency and maturity across teams and business units\n\n\nHow organizations can go from quarterly releases to hourly software delivery\n\n\nPractical strategies to reduce lead time for changes, improve MTTR, and drive business outcomes\n\u201cKnowing your deployment frequency isn\u2019t enough. AI shows you why it\u2019s happening\u2014and how to fix it.\u201d \u2014 Naveen, CEO of Truxt.ai\nKey Topics Covered:\nDevOps maturity and adoption barriers\n\n\nDORA vs SPACE vs real-world bottlenecks\n\n\nAI integration across GitHub, Jira, Jenkins, and more\n\n\nHow AI elevates software delivery from metrics to insights\n\n\nReducing complexity from 6\u201315 DevOps tools down to actionable recommendations\n\n\nBusiness impact: faster releases, better margins, improved go-to-market speed\nIndustry Insight:\nOnly 8% of organizations can deploy code hourly, yet 24% want to. AI-powered analytics like Truxt.ai can help close this gap.\n\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:06 - Unveiling Truxt.ai: Integrating AI for Enhanced Decision Making\n02:31 - Navigating and Enhancing DevOps Performance\n05:13 - Streamlining Innovation: Accelerating Development and Standardization Across Enterprises\n08:30 - Embracing the Future: DevOps, AI, and Community Engagement",

I want to share my struggles with mental health and the lessons I\u2019ve learned from Systems operation and DevOps that have helped me get by and frame my struggle in a manageable way.\n\nI want to start a conversation to:\n\n    Help reduce the stigma of Mental Illness by talking about it\n    Provide some illustration of things that have helped me, so hopefully they can help you\n    Show how the concepts of DevOps have application reaching beyond High Technology\n    Spark further conversation about Mental health in tech\n    Hopefully provide a new group and community for those for whom mental health is a concern",

        "videoDescription":"Laura Santamaria is a lead developer advocate at Dell Technologies. She loves to learn and explain how things work to bridge the gaps in engineering disciplines. Laura sat down with the All Things Open team at DevOpsDays Raleigh to talk about DevOps and system science, organizational change, and learning through meetups and events.\n\n0:00 - Introduction\n0:08 - Welcome Laura Santamaria\n0:58 - Can you share a few key takeaways that you shared with the audience here? \n2:40 - What's happening in DevOps, a topic, a trend, a debate, that people should be aware of?\n4:30 - What's one piece of advice that you want to share with the All Things Open community?\n5:40 - How can people find you on the socials?\n\nKey takeaways\n* if you want to make a transformation stick, if you want to bring changes to your company and make sure that it continues past day one or day zero, you're looking at how to ensure equilibrium across multiple systems within your company.\n\n* The best way to ensure that your change sticks in an organization is to think through a CHAOS thought experiment.\n\n* I think that a lot of people believe that DevOps is old-fashioned and it's kind of not really relevant anymore, but they don't understand that it's not about the tools. It's not about these processes that a lot of people have implemented over time. It's really about the people and about the changes you're trying to make over this course of time.\n\n* Join your local meetup. If you can't find one, make one. It's completely okay to have multiple meetups in a city, but bring them all back because that's really where we learn.\n\n\n###\n\nAbout All Things Open\nAll Things Open is a universe of open source events and platforms designed to educate and connect technologists around the world.

This session focused on how architecture-driven Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and InnerSourcing can transform the way DevOps teams build, share, and manage infrastructure at scale.\n\nKey Takeaways:\nInnerSourcing with Custom Terraform Modules \u2013 We introduced custom Terraform modules built on InnerSourcing principles, enabling teams to collaborate and contribute to a shared infrastructure codebase. By applying open-source methodologies within an organization, DevOps teams gain flexibility, efficiency, and reusability while reducing silos.\n\nView Permissions in User Management \u2013 Security and governance are critical in modern DevOps workflows. This feature allows granular access control, ensuring that only the right people have visibility into specific resources, balancing security with operational efficiency.\n\nThe Future of Infrastructure Collaboration \u2013 As organizations scale, having a decentralized but structured approach to infrastructure management is key. We discussed how InnerSourcing, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and DevOps best practices can help teams move faster while maintaining control.\n\nKeywords: DevOps, InnerSourcing, Infrastructure as Code, IaC, Terraform, cloud automation, platform engineering, security and governance, DevOps collaboration, access management, software development\n\nChapters:\n\n0:00 - Intro\n3:15 - InnerSourcing with Custom Terraform Modules\n25:21 - View Permissions in User Management\n29:46 - Q\/A and more\n\n\n#infrastructuremanagement  #devops  #OfficeHours #Reduceddowntime #securityupdates s #rbac  #ProjectTemplates #ContainerRegistries #cloudnative  #techwebinar",

        "videoDescription":"Welcome to Episode 6 of our Kubernetes series! In this video, we'll dive into three core Kubernetes concepts that are essential for any developer or DevOps professional: Namespaces, ConfigMaps, and Secrets. By the end of this episode, you'll have a solid understanding of how these tools help you organize, configure, and secure your applications in a Kubernetes environment.\n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f Namespaces: Your Key to Organization\n\nNamespaces are a fundamental way to divide your cluster's resources. Think of a namespace as a virtual cluster within your physical Kubernetes cluster. They're designed to help you:\n\nOrganize Resources: They prevent naming conflicts when multiple teams or applications use the same cluster. For instance, you could have a development namespace and a production namespace, each with its own nginx-deployment without any conflicts.\n\nIsolate Environments: Namespaces provide a scope for resource names. You can list all the pods in the production namespace, keeping them separate from those in the development namespace.\n\nEnhance Security: By using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), you can define policies that restrict users or teams to specific namespaces, ensuring they can only interact with the resources they're authorized to access. This is particularly useful in multi-tenant environments.\n\n\u2699\ufe0f Managing Application Configuration\nWhen deploying applications, you often need to provide configuration data and credentials. Kubernetes offers two primary resources for this: ConfigMaps and Secrets. Understanding the difference is crucial.\n\n1. ConfigMaps: For Non-Sensitive Data\nA ConfigMap is an API object used to store non-confidential data in key-value pairs. \ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f It's perfect for things like:\n\nEnvironment variables\nConfiguration files\nCommand-line arguments\n\nConfigMaps decouple your application's configuration from its code, making it easy to change settings without rebuilding your container image. They are stored as plain text, so NEVER use them for sensitive information.\n\n2. Secrets: For Sensitive Data\n\nA Secret is similar to a ConfigMap but is specifically designed to hold sensitive information. The data in a Secret is base64-encoded by default, which is a form of encoding, NOT encryption. \ud83e\udd2b Secrets are used to store:\n\nPasswords\nOAuth tokens\nSSH keys\n\nFor the highest level of security, consider integrating an external secret management tool like HashiCorp Vault. These tools provide robust encryption, audit logs, and dynamic secrets, offering a much more secure solution than Kubernetes' built-in Secrets.\n\n\ud83c\udfac Ready to Learn More?\nNow that you've got a handle on Namespaces, ConfigMaps, and Secrets, you're ready to start building more organized and secure applications in Kubernetes. Watch our video to see these concepts in action and learn how to implement them in your own projects!
