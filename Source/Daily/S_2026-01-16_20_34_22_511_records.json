        "videoDescription":"Differences and Overlaps of Cloud and DevOps Engineer Roles as well as deep dive of Cloud Engineer Tasks and Responsibilities\n\nDevOps engineer and Cloud engineer are 2 popular roles in software engineering. But there is a lot of mix up of these two roles and many people and many companies often use them interchangeably. They mix the tasks and responsibilities of these two very often. For example there are plenty of job descriptions for \"DevOps Cloud Engineer\" or \"Cloud DevOps Engineer\", which would naturally make you think that they are the same role, but then why would you have two names for the same role?

There is a lot of discussion going on, where some people are asking whether platform engineering replaces DevOps. Many people say it goes hand in hand and is rather an addition to DevOps, but in reality it's a bit more complicated than that. Platform engineering actually changes a lot of established rules we knew about DevOps, SRE and Cloud engineering, it changes the game and introduces some new rules.\n\nSo let's clearly define, what platform engineering exactly is, more interestingly, why was there even a need for this new role and how it evolved and of course how it compares to DevOps and Cloud engineering and does it really replace any of these roles?\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac T I M E S T A M P S \u23f0  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n0:00 - Intro and Overview\n0:50 - Why Platform Engineering?

        "videoDescription":"Are you looking for the best DevOps certifications in 2023? If so, you've come to the right place! In this video, we're sharing the top 5 DevOps certifications that are likely to be in high demand in 2023.\nDevOps certifications are one of the best ways to show hiring managers that you're qualified for a technical position. They're also a great way to set yourself up for more advanced career opportunities.\n\n\n\nIn this video we will cover the following topics:\n\n00:00 -  Introduction\n01:42 - Why Certifications are Important\n03:35 - Python Certification\n05:30 - Docker\n06:15 - Kubernetes\n08:22 - Terraform\n08:57 - Linux\n10:16 - Conclusion\n\nWant to view a clear path to becoming a DevOps Engineer? Visit our website - www.kodekloud.com\nWe have various Learning Paths to help you choose your next step and shape your DevOps Career. \n\nCheck out our learning paths at KodeKloud to get started:\n\n -Linux: https:\/\/bit.ly\/LinuxLearningPath\n- DevOps Learning Path: https:\/\/bit.ly\/DevOpsLearningPath-YT\n -Docker: https:\/\/bit.ly\/DockerLearningPath\n -Kubernetes: https:\/\/bit.ly\/KubernetesLearningPath\n -Infrastructure as Code(IAC): https:\/\/bit.ly\/IACLearningPath\n -Programming: https:\/\/bit.ly\/ProgrammingLearningPath\n\n \nThose new to the Programming and DevOps world often find it challenging to start their journey due to the missing basic prerequisites. For example, issues with setting up a basic lab environment using VirtualBox, problems with networking, or trouble with working with the Linux CLI or text editors like vi editor. Sometimes there are issues with applications - like getting a sample application to work, problems with getting the dependencies to install correctly or trouble with getting a web server to communicate with a database server. Or, at other times, it's working with data formats like JSON or YAML.\n\nSo we have identified a gap, and we believe that this is due to missing some of the basic prerequisites, such as knowing the basics of Linux, the basics of tools like VirtualBox, or knowing the basics of the most commonly used applications like Java, Python or NodeJS or web servers like Apache, NGINX etc. As a DevOps or Cloud Engineer, it is crucial to have these basics cleared. And that\u2019s why we are helping you to bridge that gap!\n\nFor more updates on courses and tips, follow us on:\n-Website: https:\/\/kodekloud.com\/\n-LinkedIn: https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/kode...\n-Twitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/kodekloud1\n-Facebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/kodekloudtra...\n-Instagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/kodekloud\/\n-Blog: https:\/\/kodekloud.com\/blog\/\n\n#itcertifications  #devopscertification #kodekloud",

        "videoDescription":"DevOps engineer and Cloud engineer have similar skills and responsibilities, but their role is pretty distinct. So in this video, we'll compare and contrast the roles of the DevOps engineer and the Cloud engineer, to help you decide which one is right for you. After watching this video, you'll know which one is the right fit for your needs! \n\n\n\nIn this video we will cover the following topics:\n\n00:00 -  Introduction\n01:14 - What is a DevOps Engineer?\n02:44 - What is a Cloud Engineer?\n04:12 - What's the Difference?\n04:42 - How are they valued?\n05:53 - Which one you should consider?\n06:45 - What salary can you expect?\n07:40 - Learning Paths\n\nWant to view a clear path to becoming a DevOps Engineer? Visit our website - https:\/\/bit.ly\/Kodekloud-YT\nWe have various Learning Paths to help you choose your next step and shape your DevOps Career. \n\nCheck out our learning paths at KodeKloud to get started:\n\n -Linux: https:\/\/bit.ly\/LinuxLearningPath\n- DevOps Learning Path: https:\/\/bit.ly\/DevOpsLearningPath-YT\n -Docker: https:\/\/bit.ly\/DockerLearningPath\n -Kubernetes: https:\/\/bit.ly\/KubernetesLearningPath\n -Infrastructure as Code(IAC): https:\/\/bit.ly\/IACLearningPath\n -Programming: https:\/\/bit.ly\/ProgrammingLearningPath\n\n \nThose new to the Programming and DevOps world often find it challenging to start their journey due to the missing basic prerequisites. For example, issues with setting up a basic lab environment using VirtualBox, problems with networking, or trouble with working with the Linux CLI or text editors like vi editor. Sometimes there are issues with applications - like getting a sample application to work, problems with getting the dependencies to install correctly or trouble with getting a web server to communicate with a database server. Or, at other times, it's working with data formats like JSON or YAML.\n\nSo we have identified a gap, and we believe that this is due to missing some of the basic prerequisites, such as knowing the basics of Linux, the basics of tools like VirtualBox, or knowing the basics of the most commonly used applications like Java, Python or NodeJS or web servers like Apache, NGINX etc. As a DevOps or Cloud Engineer, it is crucial to have these basics cleared. And that\u2019s why we are helping you to bridge that gap!\n\nFor more updates on courses and tips, follow us on:\n-Website: https:\/\/kodekloud.com\/\n-LinkedIn: https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/kode...\n-Twitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/kodekloud1\n-Facebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/kodekloudtra...\n-Instagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/kodekloud\/\n-Blog: https:\/\/kodekloud.com\/blog\/\n\n#devopsengineer   #cloudengineer  #kodekloud",

        "videoDescription":"This video captures my presentation delivered at the DevOps Meetup in Z\u00fcrich on January 25, 2024, where I delve into the prevalent challenges faced by traditional DevOps methodologies, characterized by isolated teams and fragmented value streams that impede efficiency. It explores DevOps as a holistic culture, mindset, and suite of technical practices designed to foster continuous value delivery, prioritize products over projects, and focus on customer-centric development. Additionally, I introduce Platform Engineering as a strategic evolution of DevOps aimed at mitigating the technical and operational complexities encountered when scaling DevOps in larger enterprises. Highlighting a collaborative project with LGT and Z\u00fchlke, I present the Platform Plane case study, demonstrating how an internal developer platform can streamline and standardize DevOps processes across various teams, thereby reducing cognitive load and enhancing productivity. This presentation goes beyond theoretical discussion, offering a hands-on demonstration of the Platform Plane and its functionalities, including Kubernetes as a service, API gateway, and Service Mesh, among others. It illustrates the vital role of Platform Engineering in enabling product teams to adopt DevOps more efficiently and effectively, leading to an optimized development lifecycle.\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac T I M E S T A M P S \u23f0  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n00:00 Intro\n00:08 Welcome\n00:31 About me\n02:36 Today's challenges\n04:33 DevOps is here to help\n05:20 Who is DevOps?\n06:44 The Benefit of DevOps\n08:05 DevOps is bullshit?\n08:27 What are the Challenges with DevOps?\n08:59 You build it you run it\n10:18 Think about that on scale.\n11:06 Can you scale DevOps?\n11:23 Example of What companies want\n15:50 The Digital Factory \n16:35 Platform Engineering Enables DevOps in Product Teams.\n18:30 The Gartner Top Strategic Technology Trends for 2024. \n19:29 Platform Engineering Improves DevOps Efficiency.\n20:24 The Platform Plane: Big Picture.\n22:04 The Platform Plane: High Level Architecture\n21:56 Demo 1 - The Admin Areas\n25:56 Demo 2 - Platform Plane\n26:01 Platform Plane- Main page\n26:27 Documentations\n27:38 AI Assistant\n29:21 Platform plane:\n30:12 - GitLab\n30:44 - Repositories \n32:13 - Registry\n33:40 - Package Management\n36:42 - Hypervisor ( virtual machines)\n36:52 - Identity \n37:56- Chat\n39:07 Summary\n39:45 Outro\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac  L I N K S  \ud83d\udd17\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nPlatform Plane: \n\u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/rSUI6-R4DlM\n\nLGT: \n\u27a4 https:\/\/www.lgt.com\/\n\nZ\u00fchlke: \n\u27a4 https:\/\/www.zuehlke.com\/\n\nDevOps Meetup Z\u00fcrich: \n\u27a4 https:\/\/www.meetup.com\/devops-meetup-zurich\/\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Want to learn more? \ud83d\ude80  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \n\nYou're developing products, not projects \n\u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/ImbhUFr6suw?si=UeSOAR67hZcJWE5T\n\nDevOps \n\u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/Ath3XoLbYxY?si=xzJzs4Fqpst6uxqm\n\nApply continous testing and build-in quality \n\u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/W0QZRpf7ElM?si=oe54rFG0uEXtHUbJ\n\nApply continous security \n\u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/340YmM08Eb0?si=QFOGkCnUElDXevR-\n\nBuild a platform\n \u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/UE8mSt55xHw?si=cc6_S_6Wv6iwA_y1\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac  S U B S C R I B E  \ud83d\udd14 \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \n\u2554\u2550\u2566\u2557\u2554\u2566\u2557\u2554\u2550\u2566\u2550\u2566\u2566\u2566\u2566\u2557\u2554\u2550\u2557\n\u2551\u255a\u2563\u2551\u2551\u2551\u255a\u2563\u255a\u2563\u2554\u2563\u2554\u2563\u2551\u255a\u2563\u2550\u2563\n\u2560\u2557\u2551\u255a\u255d\u2551\u2551\u2560\u2557\u2551\u255a\u2563\u2551\u2551\u2551\u2551\u2551\u2550\u2563\n\u255a\u2550\u2569\u2550\u2550\u2569\u2550\u2569\u2550\u2569\u2550\u2569\u255d\u255a\u2569\u2550\u2569\u2550\u255d\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCXvlc9x4zlv5DEqbby55Ivg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Connect with me \ud83d\udc4b  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nLINKEDIN                  \u25ba https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/romanoroth\/\nTWITTER                   \u25ba https:\/\/twitter.com\/RomanoRoth\nINSTAGRAM             \u25ba https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/romanoroth\/\nFACEBOOK               \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/romanoroth\/\nMEETUP                   \u25ba https:\/\/www.meetup.com\/de-DE\/DevOps-Meetup-Zurich\/\nCONFERNCE            \u25bahttps:\/\/www.devopsdays.ch\/\nHOMEPAGE              \u25ba  https:\/\/www.romanoroth.com\/\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac  P L A Y L I S T S  \u25b6\ufe0f \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nModern Software Engineering\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLrsbMazVPK_rb56rZQr2fyBGR3cyanZpX\nDevOps\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLrsbMazVPK_ro3fn1G-3Ui2mBPHxOD9kF\nGitLab: Build a DevSecOps Pipeline\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLrsbMazVPK_qhf3ahA_zRPlwBaGGhSu2P\n\n#devsecops  #devops #romanoroth #platformengineering",

Request only private parallel jobs unless you have a valid reason for public jobs.\n\nApproval Timeframe: It typically takes 24 to 48 hours for Microsoft to approve parallel job requests.\n\nVerification: After approval, you can verify the availability of parallel jobs in the Azure DevOps portal under the \"Parallel Jobs\" section in the billing settings.\n\nBilling Setup for Additional Jobs: For additional parallel jobs, users need an active Azure subscription (e.g., Pay-As-You-Go), and setup billing, linking it to the Azure subscription. This will allow for purchasing more parallel jobs if needed.\n\n\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83c\udfeb This complete tutorial is compiled by Sandeep Soni, a Microsoft Certified Trainer, a Software & Corporate Trainer for 27years!  \nFor more Training Courses Visit: https:\/\/www.bestitcourses.com\n\n\ud83d\udcf2 \ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf0\ud835\ude01 \ud835\ude04\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf5 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff\ud83d\udc4b \nCall Sandeep Soni for Career Guidance \u25ba +91 98490 01840 \nConnect with me on LINKEDIN \u25ba https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/sandeepsoni123\/ \n \n\ud83d\udc4d \ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb'\ud835\ude01 \ud835\uddd9\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf4\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude01 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddfc \n- Like the video if you found it helpful. \n- Subscribe to our channel for more DevOps tutorials and certification guides. \n- Hit the bell icon to get notified of our latest videos. \n\n\ud83d\udcac Join the Conversation \nHave questions or need further clarification?

It\u2019s huge right now in the tech community, and it\u2019s definitely becoming more central to how teams build software.\nIf you\u2019re starting with DevOps, this video will help you understand the basics and give you a good head-start on your journey. You will also learn about the different stages in DevOps, what tools are needed at each stage, and how potential problems should be handled.\n\nStart your DevOps Career (Beginners - Advanced) - https:\/\/bit.ly\/DevOpsLearningPath-YT\n\nIn this video we will cover the following topics:\n\n00:00 -  Introduction\n00:27 - Problems before DevOps\n01:33 - Two Stages of DevOps\n02:12 - Real World Scenario 1\n03:28 - Real World Scenario 2\n04:12 - Automation\n05:06 - Benefits of DevOps\n06:10 - Summary\n07:22 - Conclusion\n \nThose new to the Programming and DevOps world often find it challenging to start their journey due to the missing basic prerequisites. For example, issues with setting up a basic lab environment using VirtualBox, problems with networking, or trouble with working with the Linux CLI or text editors like vi editor. Sometimes there are issues with applications - like getting a sample application to work, problems with getting the dependencies to install correctly or trouble with getting a web server to communicate with a database server. Or, at other times, it's working with data formats like JSON or YAML.\n\nSo we have identified a gap, and we believe that this is due to missing some of the basic prerequisites, such as knowing the basics of Linux, the basics of tools like VirtualBox, or knowing the basics of the most commonly used applications like Java, Python or NodeJS or web servers like Apache, NGINX etc. As a DevOps or Cloud Engineer, it is crucial to have these basics cleared. And that\u2019s why we are helping you to bridge that gap!\n\nWant to view a clear path to becoming a DevOps Engineer?

        "videoDescription":"As we close out 2025, many DevOps engineers are facing the same question:\nShould I continue growing in DevOps, or is it time to transition into MLOps, AIOps, or DataOps?\n\nWith AI agents and agentic workflows increasingly automating infrastructure and operations, it\u2019s natural to wonder how these changes impact DevOps roles and career paths going into 2026.\n\nIn this video, I break down what\u2019s actually changing \u2014 and what isn\u2019t. You\u2019ll get a clear, practical explanation of DevOps, MLOps, AIOps, and DataOps, how AI agents fit across all of these domains, and how to think about your career without chasing hype or fear-driven narratives.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll learn in this video:\n\nWhy DevOps is not dying, but evolving into specialized domains\n\nThe real difference between DevOps, MLOps, AIOps, and DataOps\n\nWhere AI agents and agentic workflows actually fit in operations\n\nWhen it makes sense to stay in DevOps\n\nWhen transitioning to MLOps, AIOps, or DataOps is the right move\n\nWhy these paths are not mutually exclusive\n\nHow to choose a direction based on the problems that genuinely excite you\n\nThis video is designed for engineers who want clarity, not clickbait \u2014 and who want to make career decisions grounded in real systems, real demand, and real interest.\n\nIf this helped you understand where the industry is heading, consider subscribing. In upcoming videos, I\u2019ll go deeper into each specialization \u2014 DevOps, MLOps, AIOps, and DataOps \u2014 with real-world context and practical insights.\n\n#DevOps #MLOps #AIOps #DataOps #DevOpsCareer #AIAgents #AgenticWorkflows #CloudEngineering #FutureOfDevOps",

They both start with Git, but their fundamental philosophies on how you build, test, and deploy software couldn't be more different.

OPA provides a high-level declarative language that lets us specify policies as code and simple APIs to offload policy decision-making from our software. We can use OPA to enforce policies in microservices, Kubernetes, CI\/CD pipelines, API gateways, and more. \nIn kubernetes, OPA uses admission controllers.\n\nWhat is OPA Gatekeeper?\n\nOPA Gatekeeper is a specialized project providing first-class integration between OPA and Kubernetes.\nOPA Gatekeeper adds the following on top of plain OPA:\n\u25cf An extensible, parameterized policy library.\n\u25cf Native Kubernetes CRDs for instantiating the policy library (aka \u201cconstraints\u201d).\n\u25cf Native Kubernetes CRDs for extending the policy library (aka \u201cconstraint templates\u201d).\n\u25cf Audit functionality.\n\nWhy you need Gatekeeper?\n\nAs a Platform DevOps engineer managing multiple Kubernetes clusters for various projects, you face challenges when users deploy applications without adhering to best practices. Key issues include:\n  1.     Lack of ownership unless users apply labels themselves.\n  2.     No resource limits, leading to high costs.\n  3.     Untrusted images impacting other applications.\n  4.     Security and best practice violations across clusters.\n\nTo address these, we need governance to enforce limits and rules via policies. OPA Gatekeeper can be configured to implement these policies, ensuring best practices are followed.\n\nFollow my mentors too : @PavanElthepu    @MPrashant   @GouravSharma   @cloudwithraj   @AntonPutra   @AbhishekVeeramalla   @kubesimplify   @kshindi   @DevOpsJourney \n\nTags : #prometheus   #secrets #docker  #k8s #kubernetes #cncf #rbac #serverless #grafana #autoscaling #deployment  #opensource #devops #grafana #vault #terraform #kustomize #etcd #controlplane #container #opa #dockerhub #gatekeeper",

It's distributed so people around the world can share code\n2. It does version control\n\nSo, with version control, you can take snapshots of the state of your current code and maintain a history.\n\nBranching is really the third thing. Git branches allow developers to do isolated development and take chances without messing up the main branch.\n\nSo when someone asks me 'What is Git?', that is how I typically respond.",

Platform Engineering focusses on the building the infrastructure and the systems that are needed for running your applications and supporting your application throughout the software life cycle. So,  the goal  is to support the developers in the organisation and treat them as customers. That\u2019s why we have in platform engineering the concept of IDP Internal developer platform.\n \nSo, this platform is treated as an actual product and the customers of the product are the developers.\nWhat is the role of the IDP?\nIt is to create a thin layer on top of the toolchain that is used inside the organisation to standardise the processes and help developers to have one way to deploy into production\n\nWHO AM I:\nHey friends, welcome to my YouTube channel  @outofdevops  .

Their job includes coming up with innovative recipes, testing them, and adding the successful ones to the menu. At the same time, they also prepare food to meet the regular demand of customers who visit the restaurant daily. This dual responsibility of innovation and ongoing service can become overwhelming, especially during busy hours when the kitchen is already at full capacity.\n\nWait staff, on the other hand, focus on delivering the prepared food to customers. Their primary role is to ensure that the food reaches the diners promptly and in perfect condition, keeping the restaurant\u2019s operations running smoothly.\n\nExperimenting with a new dish during peak hours, however, becomes a significant challenge. The process of testing new recipes while maintaining the flow of regular orders often leads to disruptions in the kitchen, causing delays and dissatisfaction among customers.\n\nTo address this, the restaurant hires a kitchen manager. The kitchen manager creates a separate small kitchen dedicated to experimenting with new dishes. This ensures that the chefs can focus on their innovations without interfering with the ongoing operations. Once a dish is perfected, the kitchen manager introduces automation, such as using a conveyor belt, to streamline the cooking process. This allows the new dish to be produced efficiently alongside the existing menu items while ensuring there are no interruptions in serving food to the restaurant's customers.\n\nYes, DevOps engineers are none other than automation experts.\n\n#devops #devopsengineer #careerguidance  #newvlog  #trendingreels \n\nroles and responsibilities devops engineer\ndoes devops engineer need coding\nwhat is devops for beginners\nroles of a devops engineer\njob description of devops engineer\nrequirements for devops engineer\nskills required for devops engineer\ndefinition of devops engineer\n@Ajayhr_01",

        "videoDescription":"In this series we will learn the concepts of DevOps from a perspective of developers. How can these concepts help us be better developers and managers in our day to day jobs. In a startup you might need to fill the shoes of a DevOps, in a big company you might need to communicate with a DevOps team that has wildly different ideas.\n\nWe will gain a different perspective and understanding of the entire process by leaving our comfort zone and focusing on the wider picture. We will learn about different disciplines such as platform engineering and so much more.\n\nIn the first installment we discuss version control. As developers, we see it as a tool to collaborate and save our code. To track our mistakes and changes. In this video we learn why it's a crucial nexus point with the DevOps team and how we can work better to enable that.\n\n\u2705  You can see the article that goes with this post here: https:\/\/debugagent.com\/devops-for-developers-introduction-and-version-control\n\n\u2705  Check out the full series in the blog here: https:\/\/debugagent.com\/series\/devops4dev\n\n\u2705  Check out the playlist for this series here: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2HatFLh4xoA&list=PL8GhfcywW9YOA5i7kEFdNYFuluotS2JTZ\n\n\u2705  Check out https:\/\/debugagent.com\/ for other great content.\n\nTitle: DevOps 4 Devs-Introduction: Basic DevOps Tools & Version Control | git\n\n===============================\n\n\u2705  Subscribe To Channel For More Great Content on debugging and programming: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@debugagent \n\n\u2705  Stay Connected With Me.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Twitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/debugagent \n\ud83d\udc49 LinkedIn: https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/shai-almog-81a42\/ \n\ud83d\udc49 Website: https:\/\/debugagent.com\/ \n\ud83d\udc49 GitHub: https:\/\/github.com\/shai-almog \n\ud83d\udc49 Mastodon: https:\/\/mastodon.social\/@debugagent \n\n=============================\n\n\u2705  Recommended Playlists: \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Practical Debugging at Scale Course - Module 1: \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=A919j_5qE0k&list=PL8GhfcywW9YM3OsfxnaxAci6dJgkuOQWn \n\n\u2705  Other Videos You Might Be Interested In Watching: \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Practical Debugging at Scale Part 3: Watch and Evaluate   \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DGjVVKCNosM \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Practical Debugging at Scale Part 2: Program Control Flow   \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=GSeg5L31XXw \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Practical Debugging at Scale Part 1: Introduction   \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=A919j_5qE0k \n\n=============================\n\n\ud83d\udd14 Subscribe to our channel for more videos on debugging and programming: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@debugagent \n\n=================================\n\nDisclaimer: We do not accept any liability for any loss or damage which is incurred from you acting or not acting as a result of listening to any of our publications.

To learn more check out https:\/\/debugagent.com\/\n\nThis channel contains videos that comprise the first module covering debugging. Here we focus on IntelliJ\/IDEA and  Java\/JVM but the basic logic and tooling should be applicable to many other IDEs and platforms. We discuss debugging features that are niche and often unknown e.g.:\n\n* Marker Objects\n* Entry Renderers\n* Instance tracking\n* Memory object inspection\n* Tracepoints\/Logpoints\n\nand much more!\n\nBy leveraging these tools and techniques you will gain access to the secret weapon of senior developers and consultants. This will make you a better developer and a happier one. \n\nIn the following modules we cover:\n* Debugging Theory\n* Tooling\n* Writing Debuggable Code\n* Kubernetes (k8s)\n* Serverless\n* Fullstack\n* Observability \n\nThe full course includes more than 5 hours of video material.",

That's typically the config stuff in the hidden .git folder, including things like:\n\n- Refspec\n-Packfiles\n- The HEAD Pointer\n- Git References\n- Remote References\n- Transfer Protocols\n- Garbage Collector\n- Recovery files\n- Tree Objects\n- Environment variables\n\nHopefully you don't have to get your hands dirty with the Git plumbing too often. It's nice to stick with the Git porcelain.\n\nBut at the same time, plumbers do make a lot of money!",

What Is RabbitMQ?\n\nRabbitMQ is an open-source message broker \u2014 it acts as a middleman between different parts of a system that need to communicate asynchronously.\nIt uses the AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) as its core protocol.\n\nIn simpler terms:\n\nIt receives messages from producers (applications sending data),\n\nStores them temporarily in queues,\n\nAnd delivers them to consumers (applications receiving data).\n\nThis helps decouple systems \u2014 the sender and receiver don\u2019t need to be active at the same time.\n\n\u2699\ufe0f 2. Why Use RabbitMQ?\n\n\u2705 Decoupling \u2013 Producers don\u2019t need to know who consumes messages.\n\u2705 Asynchronous communication \u2013 Improves system responsiveness.\n\u2705 Load balancing \u2013 Messages can be distributed across multiple consumers.\n\u2705 Reliability \u2013 Ensures message delivery even if parts of the system fail.\n\u2705 Scalability \u2013 You can add more queues or consumers easily.\n\u2705 Flexible routing \u2013 Decide how messages flow using exchanges and routing keys.\n\n\ud83d\udd29 3. Core RabbitMQ Concepts\n\ud83c\udfed Producers\n\nApplications that send messages to RabbitMQ.\nThey don\u2019t send messages directly to a queue but to an exchange.\n\n\ud83c\udfaf Exchanges\n\nAn exchange routes messages to queues based on routing rules.\n\nExchange types:\n\nType Behavior Example Use Case\nDirect Routes messages to queues whose binding key exactly matches routing key Task queues\nFanout Broadcasts all messages to all queues bound to it Notifications, pub\/sub\nTopic Routes messages based on pattern matching (* and #) Selective subscriptions\nHeaders Routes based on header attributes Advanced filtering\n\nFollow my mentors too :\n\n@PavanElthepu    @MPrashant   @GouravSharma   @cloudwithraj   @AntonPutra   @AbhishekVeeramalla   @kubesimplify   @kshindi   @DevOpsJourney \n\n\n#docker  \n#k8s \n#kubernetes \n#cncf \n#kubernetestutorialforbeginners \n#keycloak\n#postgresql\n#kubernetesfullcourse \n#opensource \n#devops\n#argocd\n#awseks\n#ingress\n#secretmanager\n#secrets\n#oidc\n#ingress\n#gatewayapi\n#rabbitmq\n#kafka\n\nTags : #prometheus  #secrets #docker  #k8s #kubernetes #cncf #rbac #serverless #grafana #autoscaling #deployment  #opensource #devops #grafana #vault #terraform #kustomize #etcd #controlplane #container #ingress  #secretmanager #eks #keycloak #postgres #argocd #secrets #csidriver #secretstore #kafka #rabbitmq",

HELLO WORLD?  \nCan anybody hear me behind the firewall...?  \n404 soul not found...\n\n(Verse 1) \nPush to prod at 3 A.M.,  \nBrain\u2019s a loop in mayhem,  \nTold myself \u201cjust one more line,\u201d  \nNow it\u2019s been seven sprints of crime.  \n\nGIT RESET --HARD!!\n\nDon\u2019t forget to update your dependencies...  \nYou wrote that logic at 2 A.M... it's trash...  \nKevin force-pushed again...\n\nYou ever deploy a microservice and pray it doesn\u2019t become a macro-disaster?  \nMy Docker container\u2019s the only thing holding me together.  \nI tried therapy once... then Jira assigned me 14 more tickets.  \nMy manager said: \u201cJust estimate in story points.\u201d  \nI said: haa\n\n(Chorus)\nHello world, hello pain,  \nIs this loop recursive or am I insane?  \nFrom Python dreams to Java screams,  \nMy RAM is low... and so are my hopes.\n\nAgile... agile... agile...  \nDeliverable... agile...\n\n(Verse 2) \nNull pointer stabbed me in the back,  \nKubernetes launched a DDoS attack.  \nStack Overflow won\u2019t answer me,  \nEven GPT said: \u201cYo bro, I\u2019d flee.\u201d\n\nBUILD FAILED!!!\n\n(Bridge)\nOne commit to rule them all...  \nOne Slack ping begins my fall...  \nYou're on-call this weekend... forever...\n\nDid you test it?  \nIt works on my machine!  \nKevin deleted the prod DB!  \nWhy is prod even accessible from the dashboard?!  \nHugOps... HugOps... HugOps...\n\nHow did I become this...?  \nI just wanted to build an app that makes cat noises...\n\n(Final Chorus)\nOhhhh HELLO WOOORLD, my sanity\u2019s gone,  \nThese tickets keep respawning at dawn.  \nManager says we\u2019re agile and fast,  \nBut this sprint\u2019s a dumpster fire blast.\n\nNOT ON PROOOOOOD!!\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n\ud83d\udd14 Like what you hear?

It's the soundtrack for late-night coding sessions, for learning, and for the union between logic and emotion.\n\nLeave a comment and tell us which part of the lyrics resonated most with you! Do you feel this DNA-DevOps in your daily routine?\n\n(Evig Eies, forever owned, forever known...)\n\nVerse 1:\n(Piano and Cello begin, sparse and reflective)\nLines of code, a digital thread,\nWeaving futures, words unsaid.\nFrom concept's spark to a living stream,\nA silent promise, a waking dream.\nChorus:\n(Bass and drums enter, subtle and driving, clean electric guitar adds texture)\nOh, DNA-DevOps, a rhythm deep inside,\nWhere logic flows and errors hide.\nEvig Eies, a truth we hold so dear,\nBuilding bridges, conquering fear.\nVerse 2:\n(Vocals become more prominent, velvety and slightly melancholic)\nThrough countless iterations, we refine,\nEach commit, a purpose, a design.\nFrom whispered thoughts to a grand display,\nGuiding progress, lighting the way.\nChorus:\n(Instrumentation builds slightly, still restrained)\nOh, DNA-DevOps, a rhythm deep inside,\nWhere logic flows and errors hide.\nEvig Eies, a truth we hold so dear,\nBuilding bridges, conquering fear.\nBridge:\n(Cello takes a more melodic lead, piano arpeggios, drums become more intricate)\nIn the quiet hum of the server's grace,\nA human touch in this digital space.\nWe learn, we grow, we adapt, we mend,\nA cycle endless, without an end.\nChorus:\n(Fuller sound, but still maintaining the minimalist feel)\nOh, DNA-DevOps, a rhythm deep inside,\nWhere logic flows and errors hide.\nEvig Eies, a truth we hold so dear,\nBuilding bridges, conquering fear.\nOutro:\n(Instrumentation slowly fades, piano and cello linger)\nEvig Eies, forever owned, forever known...\nA silent promise, deeply sown.\n(Silence)\n\n#DNADevOps #EvigEies #CodingMusic #SoftwareEngineering #DevOps #IndieMusic #AmbientPop #TechMusic #CreationCycle #originalmusic",

We recommend splitting ETL and Modelling steps largely so you can manage those scripts separately. When everything is placed in a single master PBIX file or Project, it becomes nearly impossible to manage and govern. \n\nWe touch on governance in this video, but we do not go into detail. Ultimately, the application of your governance layers within your Power BI or Fabric environment must align with your corporate model. We do have recommendations, and we have seen success and failure in multiple organisations. This is not just about putting rules in place; really, the governance of Power BI has to fit your organisation to be successful. \n\nWe absolutely love Kerry Kolosko's site and if you are looking to start with SVG's she has a fantastic library to help you get started. \nhttps:\/\/kerrykolosko.com\/\n\nAs we approach the end of this series, we invite you to comment below on what you would like us to do next.

Luke drops wisdom on platform engineering, the rise of AI agents with their impact on DevOps, and how he rewrote entire Terraform libraries because apparently, sleep is optional.\n\nAlso in this episode:\n\n- Why password resets are a scam (Forrester says $70 a pop \u2014 no thanks).\n- The glorious chaos of auditors asking for 30-day resets in 2025 (because security theater must go on).\n- Andy\u2019s obsession with Linux Mint Debian Edition and the Tux shrine on his desk.\n- The legendary Domino\u2019s Pizza Terraform provider. Yes. That\u2019s real.\n \nWe also answer critical questions like:\n\n- Can an AI agent wreck your entire Git repo?\n- Should sysadmins fear change or just automate it?\n- And what\u2019s more powerful: Terraform CDK or the sheer willpower of a sysadmin trying to avoid YAML?\n\nGrab your favorite caffeine source, commit to main (regrets optional), and get ready to laugh, learn, and question your life choices. This one\u2019s got code, chaos, and caffeine-fueled commentary.\n\nEpisode Resources Below!\n\n- SysAdmin Weekly Companion Newsletter - https:\/\/newsletter.sysadminweekly.com\n- All Available Podcast Platforms - https:\/\/www.sysadminweekly.com\n- AndyOnTech - https:\/\/www.andyontech.com\n- ProjectRunspace - https:\/\/www.projectrunspace.org\n- Luke Orellana on LinkedIn - https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/luke-orellana\/\n- Terraform CDK Constructs - https:\/\/github.com\/Azure\/terraform-cdk-constructs",

        "videoDescription":"Welcome to Day 1  of Anisble in the DevOps Full Course by DevOpsFarm! \ud83d\ude80\n\nThis video transcript details a deep-dive tutorial on Ansible, the industry-leading Configuration as Code (CAC) tool.\n\nHere is a complete YouTube package, including the video description, chapters, and tags.\n\nYouTube Video Description\nThis is your complete, hands-on tutorial for Ansible, the powerful, agentless tool for Configuration as Code (CAC). We will show you how Ansible solves the major DevOps problem of managing and configuring hundreds of servers efficiently and consistently.\n\nWe begin by establishing the crucial difference between Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform (which creates machines) and Configuration as Code tools like Ansible (which configures those machines).\n\nWhat you will learn in this video:\n\n\u27a4 Configuration Management Fundamentals: Understand why manual scripting on multiple machines is inefficient and how Ansible automates security hardening, software installation (like PostgreSQL, Grafana), and application deployment.\n\n\u27a4 Ansible Architecture: Learn about the Controller Node and why Ansible is agentless, using standard SSH\/SCP protocols to manage hosts, unlike other tools that require an agent installation.\n\n\u27a4 Core Concepts Explained: Deep dive into the four essential elements of Ansible:\n\n\u27a4 Modules: The basic units of work (Python scripts) that perform specific tasks (e.g., ping, shell, mysql).\n\n\u27a4 Playbooks: YAML files that define a set of tasks to run on specific hosts.\n\n\u27a4 Inventory: The list of hosts (IPs, usernames) that Ansible manages.\n\n\u27a4 Idempotence: A key concept ensuring that running the same command multiple times yields the same, predictable outcome, preventing configuration drift.\n\n\u27a4 Terraform vs. Ansible: A clear comparison, including why Terraform is better suited for Cloud (like AWS) and configuration management tools are essential for On-Premise (data center) environments.\n\nChapters :-\nTimestamp Chapter Title\n00:00:28 Introducing Ansible: Configuration as Code (CAC)\n00:01:07 Review of the DevOps SDLC Pipeline (Plan, Code, Test, Deploy)\n00:03:28 Differentiating Terraform (IaC) vs. Configuration Management\n00:03:54 Terraform Limitations: Cloud vs. On-Premise Use Cases\n00:07:28 Defining On-Premise Infrastructure and Hypervisors\n00:08:50 The Need for Automation (The Configuration Problem)\n00:09:14 Configuration Tasks: Security Hardening, Software Installation, Monitoring Setup\n00:10:53 Why Configuration as Code (CAC) is a Must for Uniformity\n00:13:41 The Challenge: Manually Managing Configuration on 100+ Servers\n00:18:46 Introducing Ansible to Solve the Automation Challenge\n00:27:15 What is Ansible? (A Collection of Python Scripts)\n00:29:59 Key Feature: Idempotence Explained\n00:32:04 Ansible Architecture: Controller Node and Agentless Design\n00:33:37 Ansible Core Components: Modules (Shell, Database, etc.)\n00:35:48 Ansible Core Components: Playbooks (YAML), Inventory, and Roles\n00:44:22 The Advantage of Agentless Architecture (Using SSH)\n00:53:39 Introduction to Ansible Ad-Hoc Commands\n00:57:57 Testing Ad-Hoc Command Connectivity (Ping Module Demo)\n\n#Ansible\n#ConfigurationAsCode\n#CAC\n#ConfigurationManagement\n#DevOps\n#AnsibleTutorial\n#AnsibleAgentless\n#AnsibleModules\n#AnsiblePlaybooks\n#TerraformVsAnsible\n#InfrastructureAsCode\n#IAC\n#OnPremise\n#CloudComputing\n#Idempotence\n#Automation\n#DevOpsTools\n#Linux",

Hugo isn't a real engineer and therefore never learned how to write .yml in devops properly - but with AI it was very straightforward to:\n\n-- Build an action that parameterises key inputs like the branch name, environment, and other environment variables\n-- Trigger Orchestra Pipelines in staging environments with different configurations\n-- Implement polling logic to understand what pipelines are complete\n\nThe code for this example can be found at https:\/\/docs.getorchestra.io\/docs\/git-control-and-ci-cd\/ci-cd\/azure_devops\n\nReady to get started with Orchestra?

        "videoDescription":"About two years ago I was faced with the task of building a team from scratch, to rebuild and redesign an old application into a new one, more modern and flexible to include a lot of new requirements. I managed to build a small \u201cDevOps\u201d team which delivered successfully a first version of the new application. Today it is actively used in PROD, and continuously further developed. Leveraging public cloud, the team can cover the whole delivery chain in a \u201cwe build it, we own it\u201d fashion. So far, so good, until it was time to scale. In this ignite talk I want to tell the story about why my team is stuck in the face of the application scaling that is upcoming. I will be basically making a point of the need for a shared self-service platform approach on a corporate level, so that teams like mine can lift off.",

        "videoDescription":"Are you new to DevOps and wondering what Prometheus actually does? In this short video, we break it down in a simple, beginner-friendly way.\n\nPrometheus is a powerful open-source monitoring tool used by DevOps teams around the world. It pulls metrics from your servers, stores them as time-series data, and triggers alerts whenever thresholds are broken. This proactive approach helps teams detect issues before they impact users, improving uptime and system reliability.\n\nUnlike log-based monitoring, Prometheus focuses on quantitative metrics like CPU usage, memory consumption, response times, and error rates. By monitoring these metrics continuously, DevOps engineers and SREs (Site Reliability Engineers) can maintain healthy systems, reduce downtime, and scale cloud-native infrastructure efficiently.\n\nThis video is perfect for beginners who want to understand Prometheus in under 20 seconds and start applying monitoring in real-world projects. Whether you\u2019re managing corporate training platforms, retail applications, or cloud infrastructure, this knowledge is essential.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Save this video and follow the channel for more quick DevOps tutorials, beginner tips, and monitoring hacks.

        "videoDescription":"Welcome to Day 2  of Anisble in the DevOps Full Course by DevOpsFarm! \ud83d\ude80\nThis is the continuation of our comprehensive tutorial on Ansible, the powerful, agentless Configuration as Code (CAC) tool. In this session, we dive directly into the hands-on practice, demonstrating how to set up an environment and execute configuration tasks across multiple Linux machines.\n\nWe begin by establishing the crucial difference between Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform and Configuration as Code tools like Ansible. You will then be guided through provisioning the necessary AWS infrastructure using Terraform, establishing the Controller Node, and connecting it to the Managed Nodes.\n\nWhat you will learn in this session:\n\u27a4 Ansible Architecture: Reviewing the Controller Node and Managed Node design, and the vital role of Python on the Controller.\n\n\u27a4 Lab Setup: Provisioning three EC2 instances on AWS using Terraform to prepare for the demo.\n\n\u27a4 Running Commands: Understanding the two primary ways to run Ansible: Ad-Hoc Commands (for quick, one-shot testing and debugging) and Playbooks. \n\n\u27a4 Ansible Modules: Deep dive into how modules (like apt or yum) are used for specific tasks, and how to control them with parameters (e.g., present or absent).\n\n\u27a4 Mastering Inventory: A detailed breakdown of the hosts.ini file, including defining host addresses, setting connection variables (ansible_user, ansible_password), and logically organizing machines using Inventory Groups (e.g., front-end and back-end).\n\n\u27a4 Best Practices: How to use the [all:vars] section in your inventory to apply common configurations globally, adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.\n\n\u27a4 Advanced Topics: Introduction to Ansible Variables, Jinja2 Templating, and the concept of Ansible Roles for highly reusable, community-driven configurations (like installing PostgreSQL).\n\n00:00:16 \nRecap: Terraform (IaC) vs. Ansible (CAC) Differences \n\n\n00:01:11 \nReview of Ansible Components (Modules, Inventory, Playbooks, Roles) \n\n00:02:18 \nAnsible Architecture: Controller Node and Managed Nodes \n\n00:02:37 \nController Node Requirements: Python & Ansible Dependency \n\n00:04:16 \nLab Setup: Provisioning 3 AWS Machines using Terraform \n\n\n00:10:53 \nTwo Ways to Run Ansible: Ad-Hoc Commands vs. Playbooks \n\n00:11:38 \nAd-Hoc Commands: Use Cases (Quick Testing & Debugging) \n\n\n00:12:12 \nDeep Dive into Ansible Modules (e.g., Package Installation) \n\n\n\n00:13:22 \nAnsible Inventory Explained (The hosts.ini file) \n\n00:14:30 \nConfiguring Inventory: ansible_user and ansible_password \n\n00:15:39 \nOrganizing Hosts with Inventory Groups (Front-end\/Back-end) \n\n00:27:54 \nDRY Principle: Using [all:vars] for Global Configuration \n\n00:30:48 \nHands-on: Using the shell Module to Run OS Commands \n\n01:23:25 \nAnsible Variables and Special Variables \n\n01:26:19 \nIntroduction to Jinja2 Templating \n\n\n01:46:51 \nReusable Code and Ansible Roles (Postgres Example)\n\n#Ansible\n#ConfigurationAsCode\n#AnsibleTutorial\n#AnsibleInventory\n#AnsibleModules\n#AnsibleAdHoc\n#AnsibleRoles\n#TerraformVsAnsible\n#DevOps\n#IaC\n#CAC\n#AWS\n#EC2\n#LinuxAutomation\n#Jinja2\n#Automation\n#DevOpsTools",

At the same time, most institutions lacked advanced forecasting capabilities, making it difficult to anticipate and respond to rapidly changing demand.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), when combined with Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) platforms, helped transform these challenges into opportunities. AI-enabled inspection systems improved speed and consistency in quality checks, while predictive maintenance models reduced downtime by identifying potential equipment failures before they occurred. Digital worker assistance systems supported faster training, greater production flexibility, and more agile responses to disruptions.\n\nCase studies highlight this transformation in action: one global manufacturer scaled respirator production at unprecedented speed, while an industrial conglomerate rapidly established new PPE lines. These digital-first strategies improved efficiency, quality, and sustainability, even under pressure.\n\nLooking ahead, adoption of these digital capabilities remains uneven, particularly among smaller manufacturers facing infrastructure, regulatory, and talent barriers. However, the lessons from this transformation show that AI\/ML is not just a short-term emergency solution but a foundation for resilient, adaptive, and equitable supply chains.\n\n\nOfficial session recording from the Applied AI Summit 2025.\n\n\nConnect with us: \nOur website: https:\/\/www.johnsnowlabs.com\/ \nLinkedIn: https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/johnsnowlabs \nFacebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/JohnSnowLabsInc \nX: https:\/\/x.com\/JohnSnowLabs\n\n#AIDevOps #AIOps #CloudEngineering #MLOps #CICD #AIAutomation #SiteReliability",

        "videoDescription":"Welcome to Day 4 of AWS Cloud in the DevOps Full Course by DevOpsFarm! \ud83d\ude80\nThis comprehensive, hands-on tutorial dives deep into AWS Serverless Lambda, a core service for building modern, cost-effective cloud applications. We start by contrasting Lambda with traditional EC2 instances and then guide you through the entire process of creating, deploying, testing, and monitoring your first Python Lambda function.\n\nWhat you will learn in this video:\n\u27a4 Serverless Fundamentals: Understand why Lambda is the go-to choice for running code without managing servers (CPU, RAM, storage).\n\n\u27a4 Function Creation: Choose between creating a function from scratch, using a blueprint, or deploying a container image.\n\n\u27a4IAM Execution Roles: Configure the necessary Identity and Access Management (IAM) role to grant your Lambda function permissions to communicate with other AWS services like S3 or a database.\n\n\u27a4Deployment & Testing: Learn how to write code directly in the console, deploy changes, and use the built-in test feature with JSON event input.\n\n\u27a4Debugging and Logging: Use AWS CloudWatch Logs to find syntax errors, track invocations, and debug your function's execution details.\n\n\u27a4Triggers and Automation: See practical examples of setting up automated triggers, including event-based triggers (like file uploads to an S3 bucket) and scheduled Cron jobs using EventBridge.\n\n\u27a4Advanced Configurations: Cover crucial configurations such as setting up a public Lambda Function URL, using environment variables, adding tags for cost tracking, configuring a VPC for database communication, and using function versioning.\n\nBonus Topic: A brief introduction to interacting with AWS services using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI).\n\n\nServices Covered: AWS Lambda, IAM, EventBridge, CloudWatch, S3, EC2, RDS (Mentioned)\n\n\u23f1\ufe0f Chapters:\n00:00:05 \nIntroduction & Agenda (EC2, S3, RDS Review) \n00:00:44 \nWhat is AWS Lambda? (Serverless Overview) \n00:01:39 \nCreating a Lambda Function (Scratch, Blueprint, Container Image) \n00:04:11 \nConfiguring the IAM Execution Role \n00:05:16 \nDeploying and Testing Lambda Code \n00:07:59 \nDebugging with CloudWatch Logs \n00:09:50 \nUnderstanding Lambda Triggers (S3 & Scheduled Jobs Use Case) \n00:11:58 \nCreating a Cron Trigger with EventBridge \n00:18:41 \nMonitoring Lambda Metrics (Invocations, Duration, Errors) \n00:25:44 \nLambda Configuration: Permissions and Multiple Triggers \n00:27:32 \nUsing a Lambda Function URL (Public HTTPS Endpoint) \n00:32:28 \nConfiguration: Tags and VPC Settings \n00:34:40 \nLambda Versioning \n00:40:48 \nIntroduction to AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)\n\n\n#AWS #AWSTraining #AWSCloud #CloudComputing #DevOps #DevOpsFarm #AWSCertification #CloudEngineer #AWSTutorial #LearnAWS #CloudNetworking #VPC #AWSEC2 #NATGateway #CloudSkills #TechTraining #AWSForBeginners#AWSLambda\n#ServerlessComputing\n#AWSTutorial\n#DevOps\n#CloudEngineering\n#LambdaFunction\n#PythonLambda\n#IAMRoles\n#LambdaTriggers\n#EventBridge\n#CloudWatch\n#LambdaDeployment\n#AWSCLI\n#VPC\n#LambdaVersioning\n#AWSS3\n#EC2\n#AWSConfiguration",

        "videoDescription":"Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient environments that can run applications and their dependencies isolated from the host system.\n\nHere are some key concepts and commands related to Docker:\n\nImages: Docker images are the blueprints for containers. They are read-only and contain everything needed to run an application, including the code, runtime, libraries, and system tools.\n\nTo list locally available Docker images: docker images\nTo pull an image from Docker Hub (a public registry): docker pull image_name:tag\nTo build an image from a Dockerfile in your current directory: docker build -t image_name:tag .\nContainers: Containers are instances of Docker images. They are isolated from each other and the host system but share the host OS kernel.\n\nTo run a container: docker run image_name:tag\nTo list running containers: docker ps\nTo list all containers (including stopped ones): docker ps -a\nTo stop a running container: docker stop container_id\nTo remove a stopped container: docker rm container_id\nDockerfile: A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image. It specifies the base image, environment variables, and commands to run during image creation.\n\nDocker Compose: Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. You define the services, networks, and volumes in a YAML file, making it easy to manage complex applications.\n\nTo start containers defined in a docker-compose.yml file: docker-compose up\nTo stop and remove containers defined in a docker-compose.yml file: docker-compose down\nRegistry: Docker images can be stored and shared in Docker registries. Docker Hub is a popular public registry, but you can also set up private registries.\n\nVolumes: Docker volumes are used to persist data between container runs. They are separate from the container filesystem and can be shared among containers.\n\nTo create a named volume: docker volume create volume_name\nTo mount a volume when running a container: docker run -v volume_name:\/container_path ...\nNetworking: Docker provides networking options for containers, allowing them to communicate with each other or the outside world.\n\nContainers can be connected to user-defined networks, or Docker can create a default bridge network for them.",
