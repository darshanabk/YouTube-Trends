It has become a buzzword within days of its release and professionals in all fields, especially in high skilled areas like lawyers, doctors, engineers are questioning whether such AI can actually replace them and work.\n\nSo in this video I want to talk about what ChatGPT is and how it even popped up, talk a bit about the organization behind GPT called \"OpenAI\", which has already created many other machine learning models besides Chat GPT and also explain technically about all that.\nAnd then we'll dive in and actually put ChatGPT to use for some DevOps related tasks.\nI really want to see how it can help in generating configuration code for building DevOps processes or different parts of those processes and how well it knows different DevOps technologies, but not just some shallow examples or boilerplate code that I can get from official documentation, but instead also try more fine-tuning and small optimizations in that configuration code.\n\nWe're also going to check out an open source command line tool that is built on top of ChatGPT and was specifically created for engineers to generate infrastructure as code templates and more and finally we'll talk about the impact of ChatGPT, the quality and usefulness of such a tool for engineers and whether it will really replace the engineers and to what extent you should be concerned.\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac T I M E S T A M P S \u23f0  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n00:00 - Intro and Overview\n01:39 - What is ChatGPT, Who developed ChatGPT\n06:45 - Sign Up on ChatGPT\n09:23 - Create Dockerfile for Node.js app using ChatGPT\n22:13 - Create Kubernetes manifest file using ChatGPT\n35:06 - Create CI\/CD pipeline code using ChatGPT\n50:06 - Convert Jenkinsfile into GitLab CI config file\n53:53 - Tools built on top of OpenAI's API\n55:01 - AIaC demo - CLI tool for DevOps\n01:01:00 - My opinion on ChatGPT & whether ChatGPT will replace engineers\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Want to learn more? \ud83d\ude80  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nFull Python course                                            \u25ba  https:\/\/youtu.be\/t8pPdKYpowI\nFull Docker course                                            \u25ba  https:\/\/youtu.be\/3c-iBn73dDE\nFull K8s course                                                  \u25ba  https:\/\/youtu.be\/X48VuDVv0do\nDevOps Tools explained                                   \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/2W9UEq6\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Connect with me \ud83d\udc4b   \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nINSTAGRAM             \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/2F3LXYJ\nTWITTER                   \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/3i54PUB\nLINKEDIN                  \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/3hWOLVT\nFB group                   \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/32UVSZP\nDEV                            \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/3h2fqiO\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Courses & Ebooks & Bootcamp \ud83d\ude80      \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \n\u25ba Become a DevOps Engineer - full educational program             \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc   https:\/\/bit.ly\/45mXaer\n\u25ba High-Quality and Hands-On Courses                                             \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc   https:\/\/bit.ly\/3BNS8Kv\n\u25ba Kubernetes 101 - compact and easy-to-read ebook bundle      \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc   https:\/\/bit.ly\/3Ozl28x",

But there is a lot of mix up of these two roles and many people and many companies often use them interchangeably. They mix the tasks and responsibilities of these two very often. For example there are plenty of job descriptions for \"DevOps Cloud Engineer\" or \"Cloud DevOps Engineer\", which would naturally make you think that they are the same role, but then why would you have two names for the same role?

There is a lot of discussion going on, where some people are asking whether platform engineering replaces DevOps. Many people say it goes hand in hand and is rather an addition to DevOps, but in reality it's a bit more complicated than that. Platform engineering actually changes a lot of established rules we knew about DevOps, SRE and Cloud engineering, it changes the game and introduces some new rules.\n\nSo let's clearly define, what platform engineering exactly is, more interestingly, why was there even a need for this new role and how it evolved and of course how it compares to DevOps and Cloud engineering and does it really replace any of these roles?\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac T I M E S T A M P S \u23f0  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n0:00 - Intro and Overview\n0:50 - Why Platform Engineering?

So in this video, we'll compare and contrast the roles of the DevOps engineer and the Cloud engineer, to help you decide which one is right for you. After watching this video, you'll know which one is the right fit for your needs! \n\n\n\nIn this video we will cover the following topics:\n\n00:00 -  Introduction\n01:14 - What is a DevOps Engineer?\n02:44 - What is a Cloud Engineer?\n04:12 - What's the Difference?\n04:42 - How are they valued?\n05:53 - Which one you should consider?\n06:45 - What salary can you expect?\n07:40 - Learning Paths\n\nWant to view a clear path to becoming a DevOps Engineer? Visit our website - https:\/\/bit.ly\/Kodekloud-YT\nWe have various Learning Paths to help you choose your next step and shape your DevOps Career. \n\nCheck out our learning paths at KodeKloud to get started:\n\n -Linux: https:\/\/bit.ly\/LinuxLearningPath\n- DevOps Learning Path: https:\/\/bit.ly\/DevOpsLearningPath-YT\n -Docker: https:\/\/bit.ly\/DockerLearningPath\n -Kubernetes: https:\/\/bit.ly\/KubernetesLearningPath\n -Infrastructure as Code(IAC): https:\/\/bit.ly\/IACLearningPath\n -Programming: https:\/\/bit.ly\/ProgrammingLearningPath\n\n \nThose new to the Programming and DevOps world often find it challenging to start their journey due to the missing basic prerequisites. For example, issues with setting up a basic lab environment using VirtualBox, problems with networking, or trouble with working with the Linux CLI or text editors like vi editor. Sometimes there are issues with applications - like getting a sample application to work, problems with getting the dependencies to install correctly or trouble with getting a web server to communicate with a database server. Or, at other times, it's working with data formats like JSON or YAML.\n\nSo we have identified a gap, and we believe that this is due to missing some of the basic prerequisites, such as knowing the basics of Linux, the basics of tools like VirtualBox, or knowing the basics of the most commonly used applications like Java, Python or NodeJS or web servers like Apache, NGINX etc. As a DevOps or Cloud Engineer, it is crucial to have these basics cleared. And that\u2019s why we are helping you to bridge that gap!\n\nFor more updates on courses and tips, follow us on:\n-Website: https:\/\/kodekloud.com\/\n-LinkedIn: https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/kode...\n-Twitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/kodekloud1\n-Facebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/kodekloudtra...\n-Instagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/kodekloud\/\n-Blog: https:\/\/kodekloud.com\/blog\/\n\n#devopsengineer   #cloudengineer  #kodekloud",

        "videoDescription":"This video captures my presentation delivered at the DevOps Meetup in Z\u00fcrich on January 25, 2024, where I delve into the prevalent challenges faced by traditional DevOps methodologies, characterized by isolated teams and fragmented value streams that impede efficiency. It explores DevOps as a holistic culture, mindset, and suite of technical practices designed to foster continuous value delivery, prioritize products over projects, and focus on customer-centric development. Additionally, I introduce Platform Engineering as a strategic evolution of DevOps aimed at mitigating the technical and operational complexities encountered when scaling DevOps in larger enterprises. Highlighting a collaborative project with LGT and Z\u00fchlke, I present the Platform Plane case study, demonstrating how an internal developer platform can streamline and standardize DevOps processes across various teams, thereby reducing cognitive load and enhancing productivity. This presentation goes beyond theoretical discussion, offering a hands-on demonstration of the Platform Plane and its functionalities, including Kubernetes as a service, API gateway, and Service Mesh, among others. It illustrates the vital role of Platform Engineering in enabling product teams to adopt DevOps more efficiently and effectively, leading to an optimized development lifecycle.\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac T I M E S T A M P S \u23f0  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n00:00 Intro\n00:08 Welcome\n00:31 About me\n02:36 Today's challenges\n04:33 DevOps is here to help\n05:20 Who is DevOps?\n06:44 The Benefit of DevOps\n08:05 DevOps is bullshit?\n08:27 What are the Challenges with DevOps?\n08:59 You build it you run it\n10:18 Think about that on scale.\n11:06 Can you scale DevOps?\n11:23 Example of What companies want\n15:50 The Digital Factory \n16:35 Platform Engineering Enables DevOps in Product Teams.\n18:30 The Gartner Top Strategic Technology Trends for 2024. \n19:29 Platform Engineering Improves DevOps Efficiency.\n20:24 The Platform Plane: Big Picture.\n22:04 The Platform Plane: High Level Architecture\n21:56 Demo 1 - The Admin Areas\n25:56 Demo 2 - Platform Plane\n26:01 Platform Plane- Main page\n26:27 Documentations\n27:38 AI Assistant\n29:21 Platform plane:\n30:12 - GitLab\n30:44 - Repositories \n32:13 - Registry\n33:40 - Package Management\n36:42 - Hypervisor ( virtual machines)\n36:52 - Identity \n37:56- Chat\n39:07 Summary\n39:45 Outro\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac  L I N K S  \ud83d\udd17\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nPlatform Plane: \n\u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/rSUI6-R4DlM\n\nLGT: \n\u27a4 https:\/\/www.lgt.com\/\n\nZ\u00fchlke: \n\u27a4 https:\/\/www.zuehlke.com\/\n\nDevOps Meetup Z\u00fcrich: \n\u27a4 https:\/\/www.meetup.com\/devops-meetup-zurich\/\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Want to learn more? \ud83d\ude80  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \n\nYou're developing products, not projects \n\u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/ImbhUFr6suw?si=UeSOAR67hZcJWE5T\n\nDevOps \n\u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/Ath3XoLbYxY?si=xzJzs4Fqpst6uxqm\n\nApply continous testing and build-in quality \n\u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/W0QZRpf7ElM?si=oe54rFG0uEXtHUbJ\n\nApply continous security \n\u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/340YmM08Eb0?si=QFOGkCnUElDXevR-\n\nBuild a platform\n \u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/UE8mSt55xHw?si=cc6_S_6Wv6iwA_y1\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac  S U B S C R I B E  \ud83d\udd14 \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \n\u2554\u2550\u2566\u2557\u2554\u2566\u2557\u2554\u2550\u2566\u2550\u2566\u2566\u2566\u2566\u2557\u2554\u2550\u2557\n\u2551\u255a\u2563\u2551\u2551\u2551\u255a\u2563\u255a\u2563\u2554\u2563\u2554\u2563\u2551\u255a\u2563\u2550\u2563\n\u2560\u2557\u2551\u255a\u255d\u2551\u2551\u2560\u2557\u2551\u255a\u2563\u2551\u2551\u2551\u2551\u2551\u2550\u2563\n\u255a\u2550\u2569\u2550\u2550\u2569\u2550\u2569\u2550\u2569\u2550\u2569\u255d\u255a\u2569\u2550\u2569\u2550\u255d\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCXvlc9x4zlv5DEqbby55Ivg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Connect with me \ud83d\udc4b  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nLINKEDIN                  \u25ba https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/romanoroth\/\nTWITTER                   \u25ba https:\/\/twitter.com\/RomanoRoth\nINSTAGRAM             \u25ba https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/romanoroth\/\nFACEBOOK               \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/romanoroth\/\nMEETUP                   \u25ba https:\/\/www.meetup.com\/de-DE\/DevOps-Meetup-Zurich\/\nCONFERNCE            \u25bahttps:\/\/www.devopsdays.ch\/\nHOMEPAGE              \u25ba  https:\/\/www.romanoroth.com\/\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac  P L A Y L I S T S  \u25b6\ufe0f \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nModern Software Engineering\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLrsbMazVPK_rb56rZQr2fyBGR3cyanZpX\nDevOps\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLrsbMazVPK_ro3fn1G-3Ui2mBPHxOD9kF\nGitLab: Build a DevSecOps Pipeline\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLrsbMazVPK_qhf3ahA_zRPlwBaGGhSu2P\n\n#devsecops  #devops #romanoroth #platformengineering",
