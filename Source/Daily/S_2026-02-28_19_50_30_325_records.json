        "videoDescription":"Differences and Overlaps of Cloud and DevOps Engineer Roles as well as deep dive of Cloud Engineer Tasks and Responsibilities\n\nDevOps engineer and Cloud engineer are 2 popular roles in software engineering. But there is a lot of mix up of these two roles and many people and many companies often use them interchangeably. They mix the tasks and responsibilities of these two very often. For example there are plenty of job descriptions for \"DevOps Cloud Engineer\" or \"Cloud DevOps Engineer\", which would naturally make you think that they are the same role, but then why would you have two names for the same role? And that's exactly what I'm going to discuss and clarify in this video.\n\n\n\ud83d\udd17\ud83d\udca1  What is DevOps and DevOps Engineer Tasks and Responsibilities\n                                                                                                     \u25ba  https:\/\/youtu.be\/0yWAtQ6wYNM\n\ud83d\udd17\ud83d\udca1  From Zero to DevOps Engineer - Roadmap              \u25ba   https:\/\/youtu.be\/G_nVMUtaqCk\n\ud83d\udd17\ud83d\ude80  Become a DevOps Engineer in 6 months                 \u25ba   https:\/\/bit.ly\/3BPxlGf\n\ud83d\udd17\ud83d\ude80  Become a Kubernetes Administrator                        \u25ba   https:\/\/youtu.be\/pDrjQWo3CxI\n\ud83d\udd17\ud83d\ude80  Become a DevSecOps Expert and 10x your value  \u25ba   https:\/\/bit.ly\/45gUXQU\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Thank you JetBrains for sponsoring this video \ud83d\udc4f  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\nHow to Use the Space Git Flow With TeamCity \u2013 https:\/\/jb.gg\/space_git_flow \nGet started with Space for free \u2013 https:\/\/jb.gg\/jetbrains_space\nTry TeamCity for CI\/CD \u2013 https:\/\/jb.gg\/jetbrains_teamcity\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac T I M E S T A M P S \u23f0  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n0:00 - Intro and why people mix up these two roles?\n01:47 - DevOps Engineer role\n02:46 - Different Objectives of DevOps and Cloud Engineer\n04:02 - The need for Cloud Engineers\n08:42 - Cloud Engineer Task: Configure with Best Practices\n10:35 - Cloud Platform specific knowledge\n13:36 - More Cloud Engineer Tasks and Responsibilities\n15:58 - Infrastructure as Code\n17:10 - Differences between DevOps and Cloud Engineer\n17:39 - Overlaps between Cloud and DevOps Engineer \n20:25 - Wrap Up\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Want to learn more? \ud83d\ude80  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nFull Python course                                            \u25ba  https:\/\/youtu.be\/t8pPdKYpowI\nFull Docker course                                            \u25ba  https:\/\/youtu.be\/3c-iBn73dDE\nFull K8s course                                                  \u25ba  https:\/\/youtu.be\/X48VuDVv0do\nDevOps Tools explained                                   \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/2W9UEq6\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Connect with me \ud83d\udc4b   \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nLINKEDIN                           \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/3hWOLVT\nINSTAGRAM                      \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/2F3LXYJ\nTWITTER                            \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/3i54PUB\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Courses & Ebooks & Bootcamp \ud83d\ude80      \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \n\u25ba Become a DevOps Engineer - full educational program             \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc   https:\/\/bit.ly\/45mXaer\n\u25ba High-Quality and Hands-On Courses                                             \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc   https:\/\/bit.ly\/3BNS8Kv\n\u25ba Kubernetes 101 - compact and easy-to-read ebook bundle      \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc   https:\/\/bit.ly\/3Ozl28x",

There is a lot of discussion going on, where some people are asking whether platform engineering replaces DevOps. Many people say it goes hand in hand and is rather an addition to DevOps, but in reality it's a bit more complicated than that. Platform engineering actually changes a lot of established rules we knew about DevOps, SRE and Cloud engineering, it changes the game and introduces some new rules.\n\nSo let's clearly define, what platform engineering exactly is, more interestingly, why was there even a need for this new role and how it evolved and of course how it compares to DevOps and Cloud engineering and does it really replace any of these roles?\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac T I M E S T A M P S \u23f0  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n0:00 - Intro and Overview\n0:50 - Why Platform Engineering?

In this video, we're sharing the top 5 DevOps certifications that are likely to be in high demand in 2023.\nDevOps certifications are one of the best ways to show hiring managers that you're qualified for a technical position. They're also a great way to set yourself up for more advanced career opportunities.\n\n\n\nIn this video we will cover the following topics:\n\n00:00 -  Introduction\n01:42 - Why Certifications are Important\n03:35 - Python Certification\n05:30 - Docker\n06:15 - Kubernetes\n08:22 - Terraform\n08:57 - Linux\n10:16 - Conclusion\n\nWant to view a clear path to becoming a DevOps Engineer?

For example, issues with setting up a basic lab environment using VirtualBox, problems with networking, or trouble with working with the Linux CLI or text editors like vi editor. Sometimes there are issues with applications - like getting a sample application to work, problems with getting the dependencies to install correctly or trouble with getting a web server to communicate with a database server. Or, at other times, it's working with data formats like JSON or YAML.\n\nSo we have identified a gap, and we believe that this is due to missing some of the basic prerequisites, such as knowing the basics of Linux, the basics of tools like VirtualBox, or knowing the basics of the most commonly used applications like Java, Python or NodeJS or web servers like Apache, NGINX etc. As a DevOps or Cloud Engineer, it is crucial to have these basics cleared.

It\u2019s huge right now in the tech community, and it\u2019s definitely becoming more central to how teams build software.\nIf you\u2019re starting with DevOps, this video will help you understand the basics and give you a good head-start on your journey. You will also learn about the different stages in DevOps, what tools are needed at each stage, and how potential problems should be handled.\n\nStart your DevOps Career (Beginners - Advanced) - https:\/\/bit.ly\/DevOpsLearningPath-YT\n\nIn this video we will cover the following topics:\n\n00:00 -  Introduction\n00:27 - Problems before DevOps\n01:33 - Two Stages of DevOps\n02:12 - Real World Scenario 1\n03:28 - Real World Scenario 2\n04:12 - Automation\n05:06 - Benefits of DevOps\n06:10 - Summary\n07:22 - Conclusion\n \nThose new to the Programming and DevOps world often find it challenging to start their journey due to the missing basic prerequisites. For example, issues with setting up a basic lab environment using VirtualBox, problems with networking, or trouble with working with the Linux CLI or text editors like vi editor. Sometimes there are issues with applications - like getting a sample application to work, problems with getting the dependencies to install correctly or trouble with getting a web server to communicate with a database server. Or, at other times, it's working with data formats like JSON or YAML.\n\nSo we have identified a gap, and we believe that this is due to missing some of the basic prerequisites, such as knowing the basics of Linux, the basics of tools like VirtualBox, or knowing the basics of the most commonly used applications like Java, Python or NodeJS or web servers like Apache, NGINX etc. As a DevOps or Cloud Engineer, it is crucial to have these basics cleared. And that\u2019s why we are helping you to bridge that gap!\n\nWant to view a clear path to becoming a DevOps Engineer? Visit our website kodekloud.com!\nWe have various Learning Paths to help you choose your next step and shape your DevOps Career. \n\nCheck out our learning paths at KodeKloud to get started:\n\n -Linux: https:\/\/bit.ly\/LinuxLearningPath\n- DevOps Learning Path: https:\/\/bit.ly\/DevOpsLearningPath-YT\n -Docker: https:\/\/bit.ly\/DockerLearningPath\n -Kubernetes: https:\/\/bit.ly\/KubernetesLearningPath\n -Infrastructure as Code(IAC): https:\/\/bit.ly\/IACLearningPath\n -Programming: https:\/\/bit.ly\/ProgrammingLearningPath\n\nFor more updates on courses and tips, follow us on:\n-Website: https:\/\/kodekloud.com\/\n-LinkedIn: https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/kode...\n-Twitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/kodekloud1\n-Facebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/kodekloudtra...\n-Instagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/kodekloud\/\n-Blog: https:\/\/kodekloud.com\/blog\/\n\n#devops  #devopsengineer  #kodekloud",

        "videoDescription":"As we close out 2025, many DevOps engineers are facing the same question:\nShould I continue growing in DevOps, or is it time to transition into MLOps, AIOps, or DataOps?\n\nWith AI agents and agentic workflows increasingly automating infrastructure and operations, it\u2019s natural to wonder how these changes impact DevOps roles and career paths going into 2026.\n\nIn this video, I break down what\u2019s actually changing \u2014 and what isn\u2019t. You\u2019ll get a clear, practical explanation of DevOps, MLOps, AIOps, and DataOps, how AI agents fit across all of these domains, and how to think about your career without chasing hype or fear-driven narratives.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll learn in this video:\n\nWhy DevOps is not dying, but evolving into specialized domains\n\nThe real difference between DevOps, MLOps, AIOps, and DataOps\n\nWhere AI agents and agentic workflows actually fit in operations\n\nWhen it makes sense to stay in DevOps\n\nWhen transitioning to MLOps, AIOps, or DataOps is the right move\n\nWhy these paths are not mutually exclusive\n\nHow to choose a direction based on the problems that genuinely excite you\n\nThis video is designed for engineers who want clarity, not clickbait \u2014 and who want to make career decisions grounded in real systems, real demand, and real interest.\n\nIf this helped you understand where the industry is heading, consider subscribing. In upcoming videos, I\u2019ll go deeper into each specialization \u2014 DevOps, MLOps, AIOps, and DataOps \u2014 with real-world context and practical insights.\n\n#DevOps #MLOps #AIOps #DataOps #DevOpsCareer #AIAgents #AgenticWorkflows #CloudEngineering #FutureOfDevOps",

The main focus will be on the new Azure Managed DevOps Agent Pools, what they are, how they work, and why you might want to use them.\n\nWe\u2019ll start by deploying some prerequisites using Terraform, including a virtual network to host our agents. You\u2019ll see how to use the AzAPI provider to get the job done and I\u2019ll walk you through it all, step by step, as we build this Terraform project from scratch.\n\nOnce everything is up and running, we\u2019ll connect our agent to an Azure Pipeline and run a deployment to test it out.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to automate Azure DevOps agent pool provisioning with Terraform and AzAPI, or just want to learn more about CI\/CD in Azure, you\u2019re in the right place. Hope you enjoy the video!\n\nTimestamps: \n0:00 Intro\n1:00 Differences between managed devops pools and other offerings\n3:40 Comparison table between VMSS and Managed Devops Pool\n5:40 Writing our Terraform code\n27:50 Writing Terraform for our Managed Devops pool\n33:30 Deploying our code\n34:10 Create pipelines and test our pool\n38:20 Recap and outro\n\nLinks to learn documentation: \nhttps:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/devops\/pipelines\/agents\/agents?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml%2Cbrowser\nhttps:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/devops\/managed-devops-pools\/migrate-from-scale-set-agents?view=azure-devops\n\n\u2615\ufe0f Want to buy me a coffee? https:\/\/ko-fi.com\/lindbergtech\nOnly if you want to, of course\n\n\nSocials:\nLinkedIn:  https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/carl-lindberg-a7b76a175\/\nGithub: https:\/\/github.com\/carlzxc71\n\n#terraform #azure #microsoft #cloud #iac",

We can use OPA to enforce policies in microservices, Kubernetes, CI\/CD pipelines, API gateways, and more. \nIn kubernetes, OPA uses admission controllers.\n\nWhat is OPA Gatekeeper?\n\nOPA Gatekeeper is a specialized project providing first-class integration between OPA and Kubernetes.\nOPA Gatekeeper adds the following on top of plain OPA:\n\u25cf An extensible, parameterized policy library.\n\u25cf Native Kubernetes CRDs for instantiating the policy library (aka \u201cconstraints\u201d).\n\u25cf Native Kubernetes CRDs for extending the policy library (aka \u201cconstraint templates\u201d).\n\u25cf Audit functionality.\n\nWhy you need Gatekeeper?\n\nAs a Platform DevOps engineer managing multiple Kubernetes clusters for various projects, you face challenges when users deploy applications without adhering to best practices. Key issues include:\n  1.     Lack of ownership unless users apply labels themselves.\n  2.     No resource limits, leading to high costs.\n  3.     Untrusted images impacting other applications.\n  4.     Security and best practice violations across clusters.\n\nTo address these, we need governance to enforce limits and rules via policies. OPA Gatekeeper can be configured to implement these policies, ensuring best practices are followed.\n\nFollow my mentors too : @PavanElthepu    @MPrashant   @GouravSharma   @cloudwithraj   @AntonPutra   @AbhishekVeeramalla   @kubesimplify   @kshindi   @DevOpsJourney \n\nTags : #prometheus   #secrets #docker  #k8s #kubernetes #cncf #rbac #serverless #grafana #autoscaling #deployment  #opensource #devops #grafana #vault #terraform #kustomize #etcd #controlplane #container #opa #dockerhub #gatekeeper",

It's distributed so people around the world can share code\n2. It does version control\n\nSo, with version control, you can take snapshots of the state of your current code and maintain a history.\n\nBranching is really the third thing. Git branches allow developers to do isolated development and take chances without messing up the main branch.\n\nSo when someone asks me 'What is Git?', that is how I typically respond.",

Their job includes coming up with innovative recipes, testing them, and adding the successful ones to the menu. At the same time, they also prepare food to meet the regular demand of customers who visit the restaurant daily. This dual responsibility of innovation and ongoing service can become overwhelming, especially during busy hours when the kitchen is already at full capacity.\n\nWait staff, on the other hand, focus on delivering the prepared food to customers. Their primary role is to ensure that the food reaches the diners promptly and in perfect condition, keeping the restaurant\u2019s operations running smoothly.\n\nExperimenting with a new dish during peak hours, however, becomes a significant challenge. The process of testing new recipes while maintaining the flow of regular orders often leads to disruptions in the kitchen, causing delays and dissatisfaction among customers.\n\nTo address this, the restaurant hires a kitchen manager. The kitchen manager creates a separate small kitchen dedicated to experimenting with new dishes. This ensures that the chefs can focus on their innovations without interfering with the ongoing operations. Once a dish is perfected, the kitchen manager introduces automation, such as using a conveyor belt, to streamline the cooking process. This allows the new dish to be produced efficiently alongside the existing menu items while ensuring there are no interruptions in serving food to the restaurant's customers.\n\nYes, DevOps engineers are none other than automation experts.\n\n#devops #devopsengineer #careerguidance  #newvlog  #trendingreels \n\nroles and responsibilities devops engineer\ndoes devops engineer need coding\nwhat is devops for beginners\nroles of a devops engineer\njob description of devops engineer\nrequirements for devops engineer\nskills required for devops engineer\ndefinition of devops engineer\n@Ajayhr_01",

Platform Engineering focusses on the building the infrastructure and the systems that are needed for running your applications and supporting your application throughout the software life cycle. So,  the goal  is to support the developers in the organisation and treat them as customers. That\u2019s why we have in platform engineering the concept of IDP Internal developer platform.\n \nSo, this platform is treated as an actual product and the customers of the product are the developers.\nWhat is the role of the IDP?\nIt is to create a thin layer on top of the toolchain that is used inside the organisation to standardise the processes and help developers to have one way to deploy into production\n\nWHO AM I:\nHey friends, welcome to my YouTube channel  @outofdevops  .

What Is RabbitMQ?\n\nRabbitMQ is an open-source message broker \u2014 it acts as a middleman between different parts of a system that need to communicate asynchronously.\nIt uses the AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) as its core protocol.\n\nIn simpler terms:\n\nIt receives messages from producers (applications sending data),\n\nStores them temporarily in queues,\n\nAnd delivers them to consumers (applications receiving data).\n\nThis helps decouple systems \u2014 the sender and receiver don\u2019t need to be active at the same time.\n\n\u2699\ufe0f 2. Why Use RabbitMQ?\n\n\u2705 Decoupling \u2013 Producers don\u2019t need to know who consumes messages.\n\u2705 Asynchronous communication \u2013 Improves system responsiveness.\n\u2705 Load balancing \u2013 Messages can be distributed across multiple consumers.\n\u2705 Reliability \u2013 Ensures message delivery even if parts of the system fail.\n\u2705 Scalability \u2013 You can add more queues or consumers easily.\n\u2705 Flexible routing \u2013 Decide how messages flow using exchanges and routing keys.\n\n\ud83d\udd29 3. Core RabbitMQ Concepts\n\ud83c\udfed Producers\n\nApplications that send messages to RabbitMQ.\nThey don\u2019t send messages directly to a queue but to an exchange.\n\n\ud83c\udfaf Exchanges\n\nAn exchange routes messages to queues based on routing rules.\n\nExchange types:\n\nType Behavior Example Use Case\nDirect Routes messages to queues whose binding key exactly matches routing key Task queues\nFanout Broadcasts all messages to all queues bound to it Notifications, pub\/sub\nTopic Routes messages based on pattern matching (* and #) Selective subscriptions\nHeaders Routes based on header attributes Advanced filtering\n\nFollow my mentors too :\n\n@PavanElthepu    @MPrashant   @GouravSharma   @cloudwithraj   @AntonPutra   @AbhishekVeeramalla   @kubesimplify   @kshindi   @DevOpsJourney \n\n\n#docker  \n#k8s \n#kubernetes \n#cncf \n#kubernetestutorialforbeginners \n#keycloak\n#postgresql\n#kubernetesfullcourse \n#opensource \n#devops\n#argocd\n#awseks\n#ingress\n#secretmanager\n#secrets\n#oidc\n#ingress\n#gatewayapi\n#rabbitmq\n#kafka\n\nTags : #prometheus  #secrets #docker  #k8s #kubernetes #cncf #rbac #serverless #grafana #autoscaling #deployment  #opensource #devops #grafana #vault #terraform #kustomize #etcd #controlplane #container #ingress  #secretmanager #eks #keycloak #postgres #argocd #secrets #csidriver #secretstore #kafka #rabbitmq",

You have to tell it which files to include in the next Git commit. That's called staging a file in Git.\n\nSo yes, you have to stage files first, and when you're happy with your code, you perform the Git commit, and all the staged files will become part of your Git commit history.\n\nYou can learn more about staging a Git file and the git add command here:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.theserverside.com\/blog\/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions\/git-add-index-stage-file-staging-commit-combine-untracked-staging-status",

Most people think it's about learning Kubernetes, mastering CI\/CD pipelines, and deploying the right tools, so they focus on technical skills while missing what truly matters.\n\nBut here's the thing: technical expertise alone won't make you remarkable. It's your dedication to perfecting your craft that creates true mastery. The greatest experts, like Jiro who's been making sushi daily for 80 years straight, understand something most technologists never grasp.\n\nThis is an excerpt from the \ud83c\udf71 DevOps Sushi - Part 1 \ud83c\udfac movie that is now available on https:\/\/makeitwork.tv.

Learn how to automate the process of pulling work items from ADO, generating a CSV file, and placing it into a SharePoint folder for Data Shuttle to process. The workflow includes archiving old files and ensuring only the latest data is available. See a live test showcasing how updates, like \"Brooke test take two\" and \"Yuriy test one,\" are reflected in the new CSV, complete with direct URL links to specific ADO work items. We also explore future possibilities, including potentially replacing the existing Software connector, pushing data directly to Smartsheet with hyperlinks and hierarchy, and achieving bidirectional integration.",

It's the soundtrack for late-night coding sessions, for learning, and for the union between logic and emotion.\n\nLeave a comment and tell us which part of the lyrics resonated most with you! Do you feel this DNA-DevOps in your daily routine?\n\n(Evig Eies, forever owned, forever known...)\n\nVerse 1:\n(Piano and Cello begin, sparse and reflective)\nLines of code, a digital thread,\nWeaving futures, words unsaid.\nFrom concept's spark to a living stream,\nA silent promise, a waking dream.\nChorus:\n(Bass and drums enter, subtle and driving, clean electric guitar adds texture)\nOh, DNA-DevOps, a rhythm deep inside,\nWhere logic flows and errors hide.\nEvig Eies, a truth we hold so dear,\nBuilding bridges, conquering fear.\nVerse 2:\n(Vocals become more prominent, velvety and slightly melancholic)\nThrough countless iterations, we refine,\nEach commit, a purpose, a design.\nFrom whispered thoughts to a grand display,\nGuiding progress, lighting the way.\nChorus:\n(Instrumentation builds slightly, still restrained)\nOh, DNA-DevOps, a rhythm deep inside,\nWhere logic flows and errors hide.\nEvig Eies, a truth we hold so dear,\nBuilding bridges, conquering fear.\nBridge:\n(Cello takes a more melodic lead, piano arpeggios, drums become more intricate)\nIn the quiet hum of the server's grace,\nA human touch in this digital space.\nWe learn, we grow, we adapt, we mend,\nA cycle endless, without an end.\nChorus:\n(Fuller sound, but still maintaining the minimalist feel)\nOh, DNA-DevOps, a rhythm deep inside,\nWhere logic flows and errors hide.\nEvig Eies, a truth we hold so dear,\nBuilding bridges, conquering fear.\nOutro:\n(Instrumentation slowly fades, piano and cello linger)\nEvig Eies, forever owned, forever known...\nA silent promise, deeply sown.\n(Silence)\n\n#DNADevOps #EvigEies #CodingMusic #SoftwareEngineering #DevOps #IndieMusic #AmbientPop #TechMusic #CreationCycle #originalmusic",

This video explores how to run OpenClaw locally using LM Studio and an Nvidia RTX 4090 to automate system monitoring and social media summaries.\n\nHighlights:\n\nLocal Setup: Using LM Studio's developer mode to expose models via REST API.\n\nHardware: Watch an RTX 4090 pull 193W while processing local AI requests.\n\nReal Use Cases: Automating Mastodon summaries and system health checks via Cron jobs.\n\nEnterprise AI: Exploring ClawHub.ai and integrating AI agents into Azure DevOps and Kubernetes.\n\nThe Verdict: Local models are great for privacy and low-latency summarization, but cloud models (Claude Opus 4.6, GPT-5.3 Codex) still win on complex reasoning.\n\nKey Links:\n\nOpenClaw: https:\/\/openclaw.ai \n\nSkill Repository: https:\/\/ClawHub.ai \n\n\u23f1\ufe0f Timestamps:\n\n00:00:19 Welcome to AI Archwizard with Big Loaf from North Carolina talking about running local LLMs.\n00:00:34 Discussing LM Studio running on a different computer and exposing models via REST API.\n00:00:43 LM Studio has a developer mode that allows any loaded model to be accessed from a remote machine.\n00:01:12 Big Loaf uses OpenAI for OpenClaw and monitors Mastodon for popular updates.\n00:01:33 Local models are good for low latency and simple tasks like text summarization but aren't near Opus 4.6.\n00:02:11 The GPU works at 193 watts when calling the REST API.\n00:02:31 The GPU used for these local models has 24 gigs of video RAM.\n00:03:12 Only models that are currently loaded into LM Studio can be called via the API.\n00:04:44 Demonstration of the OpenClaw session running through a Telegram bot interface.\n00:05:49 The current setup is running OpenClaw version 2.1 using the Mistral model.\n00:06:55 Discussion of active cron jobs for Mastodon summarization and system performance metrics.\n00:07:52 The user is currently only using a main agent without additional skills installed.\n00:10:34 Local models sometimes fail at complex tasks where cloud models like Codex excel.\n00:11:22 Discussion on high-performing models like Claude Opus 4.6, GPT 5.3 Codex, and Gemini 3.\n00:12:06 Performing a vector database search for specific terms within the Epstein files.\n00:15:40 Receiving a 429 rate limit error on Anthropic models while paying by the request.\n00:16:09 Vertex is Google's AI studio offering for deep research and vectorizing large data.\n00:17:43 Preference for Claude Code over Codex 5.3 for operational DevOps tasks.\n00:18:24 Transitioning from Jenkins to Azure DevOps for CI\/CD pipelines at work.\n00:20:46 Mention of a new fork of OpenClaw designed with better sandboxing for security.\n00:22:31 OpenClaw is being considered for enterprise use cases like automated chatbot requests for hardware.\n00:23:14 Integration is available for Microsoft Teams to meet users where they work.\n00:25:44 Definition of agentic AI as using agents to get jobs done rather than just simple Q&A.\n00:31:26 Cost analysis of AWS Bedrock with input at $5 and output at $15 per million tokens.\n00:34:02 Skills can be created for any service that has a REST API or command line client.\n00:34:55 Exploring existing DevOps and Kubernetes skills available on ClawHub.\n00:41:02 Comparison of side projects like OpenClaw to Linux OS, starting as hobbies and ending in the enterprise.\n00:42:31 OpenClaw offers role-based access control and doesn't require exposing a Web UI to the internet.\n00:45:10 Final advice to choose models wisely based on use cases.",

        "videoDescription":"This week on SysAdmin Weekly, Andy is joined by Luke Orellana, a fellow IT war buddy from the MSP trenches who's now a Senior Engineering Manager at Microsoft (yes, that Microsoft) working with AI Agents on a daily basis!\n\nIn this episode we unpack the good, the bad, and the \"seriously, who thought YAML was a good idea\"? parts of Infra-as-Code from Terraform and Pulumi to PowerShell DSC and Packer pipelines. Luke drops wisdom on platform engineering, the rise of AI agents with their impact on DevOps, and how he rewrote entire Terraform libraries because apparently, sleep is optional.\n\nAlso in this episode:\n\n- Why password resets are a scam (Forrester says $70 a pop \u2014 no thanks).\n- The glorious chaos of auditors asking for 30-day resets in 2025 (because security theater must go on).\n- Andy\u2019s obsession with Linux Mint Debian Edition and the Tux shrine on his desk.\n- The legendary Domino\u2019s Pizza Terraform provider. Yes. That\u2019s real.\n \nWe also answer critical questions like:\n\n- Can an AI agent wreck your entire Git repo?\n- Should sysadmins fear change or just automate it?\n- And what\u2019s more powerful: Terraform CDK or the sheer willpower of a sysadmin trying to avoid YAML?\n\nGrab your favorite caffeine source, commit to main (regrets optional), and get ready to laugh, learn, and question your life choices. This one\u2019s got code, chaos, and caffeine-fueled commentary.\n\nEpisode Resources Below!\n\n- SysAdmin Weekly Companion Newsletter - https:\/\/newsletter.sysadminweekly.com\n- All Available Podcast Platforms - https:\/\/www.sysadminweekly.com\n- AndyOnTech - https:\/\/www.andyontech.com\n- ProjectRunspace - https:\/\/www.projectrunspace.org\n- Luke Orellana on LinkedIn - https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/luke-orellana\/\n- Terraform CDK Constructs - https:\/\/github.com\/Azure\/terraform-cdk-constructs",

Hugo isn't a real engineer and therefore never learned how to write .yml in devops properly - but with AI it was very straightforward to:\n\n-- Build an action that parameterises key inputs like the branch name, environment, and other environment variables\n-- Trigger Orchestra Pipelines in staging environments with different configurations\n-- Implement polling logic to understand what pipelines are complete\n\nThe code for this example can be found at https:\/\/docs.getorchestra.io\/docs\/git-control-and-ci-cd\/ci-cd\/azure_devops\n\nReady to get started with Orchestra?

        "videoDescription":"Are you new to DevOps and wondering what Prometheus actually does? In this short video, we break it down in a simple, beginner-friendly way.\n\nPrometheus is a powerful open-source monitoring tool used by DevOps teams around the world. It pulls metrics from your servers, stores them as time-series data, and triggers alerts whenever thresholds are broken. This proactive approach helps teams detect issues before they impact users, improving uptime and system reliability.\n\nUnlike log-based monitoring, Prometheus focuses on quantitative metrics like CPU usage, memory consumption, response times, and error rates. By monitoring these metrics continuously, DevOps engineers and SREs (Site Reliability Engineers) can maintain healthy systems, reduce downtime, and scale cloud-native infrastructure efficiently.\n\nThis video is perfect for beginners who want to understand Prometheus in under 20 seconds and start applying monitoring in real-world projects. Whether you\u2019re managing corporate training platforms, retail applications, or cloud infrastructure, this knowledge is essential.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Save this video and follow the channel for more quick DevOps tutorials, beginner tips, and monitoring hacks.
