You will learn what DevOps is, continuous integration, continuous deployment strategies, and application performance management. Many DevOps practices are commonly used in programming and web development, it is important to understand key terms and technologies. \n\nThis course often references the MERN (MongoDB, Express JS, React JS, Node JS) technology stack. You will get a series of talks with technology recommendations based on these best practices. There will be several programming examples embedded in these talks. As long as you know the absolute basics of coding and the web, you'll have no problem following along. \n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Course Notes \u2b50\ufe0f\n\ud83d\udd17 Lesson 1: https:\/\/layerci.com\/blog\/what-is-devops\/\n\ud83d\udd17 Lesson 2: https:\/\/layerci.com\/blog\/what-is-test-driven-development\/\n\ud83d\udd17 Lesson 3: https:\/\/layerci.com\/blog\/what-is-ci\/\n\ud83d\udd17 Lesson 4: https:\/\/layerci.com\/blog\/what-is-code-coverage\/\n\ud83d\udd17 Lesson 5: https:\/\/layerci.com\/blog\/linting-best-practices\/\n\ud83d\udd17 Lesson 6: https:\/\/layerci.com\/blog\/what-is-an-ephemeral-environment\/\n\ud83d\udd17 Lesson 7: https:\/\/layerci.com\/blog\/the-difference-between-vms-and-containers\/\n\ud83d\udd17 Lesson 8: https:\/\/layerci.com\/blog\/what-are-rolling-deployments\/\n\ud83d\udd17 Lesson 9: https:\/\/layerci.com\/blog\/what-is-a-blue-green-deployment\/\n\ud83d\udd17 Lesson 10: https:\/\/layerci.com\/blog\/what-is-autoscaling\/\n\ud83d\udd17 Lesson 11: https:\/\/layerci.com\/blog\/service-discovery\/\n\ud83d\udd17 Lesson 12: https:\/\/layerci.com\/blog\/what-is-log-aggregation\/\n\ud83d\udd17 Lesson 13: https:\/\/layerci.com\/blog\/vital-production-metrics\/\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Course Content: 3 Pillars of DevOps \u2b50\ufe0f\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Unit 1 - Code Review Automation\n\u2328\ufe0f Lesson 1  What is DevOps?\n\u2328\ufe0f Lesson 2 - What is Test Driven Development (TDD)?\n\u2328\ufe0f Lesson 3 - What is Continuous Integration (CI)? w\/ CI setup TUTORIAL\n\u2328\ufe0f Lesson 4 - What is code coverage? \n\u2328\ufe0f Lesson 5 - Linting best practices\n\u2328\ufe0f Lesson 6 - Ephemeral environments  w\/ setup TUTORIAL\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Unit 2 - Deployment Strategies\n\u2328\ufe0f Lesson 7 - Virtual Machines (VMs) vs. Containers \n\u2328\ufe0f Lesson 8 - Rolling deployments  \n\u2328\ufe0f Lesson 9 - Blue\/green deployments w\/ Continuous Deployment setup TUTORIAL\n\u2328\ufe0f Lesson 10 - What is autoscaling?\n\u2328\ufe0f Lesson 11 - What is service discovery? \n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Unit 3 - Application Performance Management (APM)\n\u2328\ufe0f Lesson 12 - What is log aggregation?\n\u2328\ufe0f Lesson 13 - Vital production metrics \n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Course Reddit Discussion Forum: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/devopsacademy\/\n\ud83c\udfa5 Course created and narrated by Colin Chartier, Co-founder and CEO at LayerCI\n\ud83d\udc26 Have feedback on the course?

In this video, Liz and Seth discuss the differences and similarities between DevOps and SRE, ultimately realizing that DevOps and SRE aren't two competing methods, but rather close friends designed help break down organizational barriers to deliver better software faster.

My opinion on whether ChatGPT will replace engineers\n\ud83d\udc9b  Follow me on LinkedIn and IG for weekly updates   \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/2F3LXYJ\n\ud83d\udc99  Become a DevOps Engineer - 6-month program       \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/43nK7ra\n\ud83d\udc9a  Mini-Bootcamp for IT Beginners                                  \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/3BRz6To\n\n#chatgpt   #techworldwithnana \n\n\u25ba  This video is sponsored by Firefly \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc\n\u25ba  For more infos: https:\/\/eu1.hubs.ly\/H02z-Lf0\n\u25ba  Open source tool AIaC: https:\/\/eu1.hubs.ly\/H02z-GD0\n\nI'm sure you have all heard of ChatGPT by now. It has become a buzzword within days of its release and professionals in all fields, especially in high skilled areas like lawyers, doctors, engineers are questioning whether such AI can actually replace them and work.\n\nSo in this video I want to talk about what ChatGPT is and how it even popped up, talk a bit about the organization behind GPT called \"OpenAI\", which has already created many other machine learning models besides Chat GPT and also explain technically about all that.\nAnd then we'll dive in and actually put ChatGPT to use for some DevOps related tasks.\nI really want to see how it can help in generating configuration code for building DevOps processes or different parts of those processes and how well it knows different DevOps technologies, but not just some shallow examples or boilerplate code that I can get from official documentation, but instead also try more fine-tuning and small optimizations in that configuration code.\n\nWe're also going to check out an open source command line tool that is built on top of ChatGPT and was specifically created for engineers to generate infrastructure as code templates and more and finally we'll talk about the impact of ChatGPT, the quality and usefulness of such a tool for engineers and whether it will really replace the engineers and to what extent you should be concerned.\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac T I M E S T A M P S \u23f0  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n00:00 - Intro and Overview\n01:39 - What is ChatGPT, Who developed ChatGPT\n06:45 - Sign Up on ChatGPT\n09:23 - Create Dockerfile for Node.js app using ChatGPT\n22:13 - Create Kubernetes manifest file using ChatGPT\n35:06 - Create CI\/CD pipeline code using ChatGPT\n50:06 - Convert Jenkinsfile into GitLab CI config file\n53:53 - Tools built on top of OpenAI's API\n55:01 - AIaC demo - CLI tool for DevOps\n01:01:00 - My opinion on ChatGPT & whether ChatGPT will replace engineers\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Want to learn more? \ud83d\ude80  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nFull Python course                                            \u25ba  https:\/\/youtu.be\/t8pPdKYpowI\nFull Docker course                                            \u25ba  https:\/\/youtu.be\/3c-iBn73dDE\nFull K8s course                                                  \u25ba  https:\/\/youtu.be\/X48VuDVv0do\nDevOps Tools explained                                   \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/2W9UEq6\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Connect with me \ud83d\udc4b   \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nINSTAGRAM             \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/2F3LXYJ\nTWITTER                   \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/3i54PUB\nLINKEDIN                  \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/3hWOLVT\nFB group                   \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/32UVSZP\nDEV                            \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/3h2fqiO\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Courses & Ebooks & Bootcamp \ud83d\ude80      \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \n\u25ba Become a DevOps Engineer - full educational program             \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc   https:\/\/bit.ly\/45mXaer\n\u25ba High-Quality and Hands-On Courses                                             \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc   https:\/\/bit.ly\/3BNS8Kv\n\u25ba Kubernetes 101 - compact and easy-to-read ebook bundle      \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc   https:\/\/bit.ly\/3Ozl28x",

This video discusses building blocks of the DevOps and SRE practice of measurement: Service Level Indicators (SLIs), Service Level Objectives (SLOs), and Service Level Agreements (SLAs):\n\n\"Service Level Objectives\" in the O'Reilly SRE Book: https:\/\/goo.gl\/3btxFE\n\n\u2192 SLIs are Service Level Indicators or metrics over time which inform about the health of a service.\n\u2192 SLOs are Service Level Objectives which are agreed upon bounds for how often those SLIs must be met.\n\u2192 SLAs are business-level agreements which define the service availability for a customer and the penalties for breaking that availability.\n\nSLIs and SLOs are the prescriptive way in which SRE practices the DevOps principle of \"measure everything\". Implementing SLOs also forces collaboration between product owners and systems operators, adhering to the DevOps principle of \"break down organizational barriers\". This is why we say class SRE implements DevOps.\n\nReach out to Liz and Seth:\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/sethvargo\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/lizthegrey\n\nWatch more episodes from the playlist here: https:\/\/goo.gl\/CKv3tV\nSubscribe to the Google Cloud Platform channel for more Cloud content: https:\/\/goo.gl\/S0AS51",

But there is a lot of mix up of these two roles and many people and many companies often use them interchangeably. They mix the tasks and responsibilities of these two very often. For example there are plenty of job descriptions for \"DevOps Cloud Engineer\" or \"Cloud DevOps Engineer\", which would naturally make you think that they are the same role, but then why would you have two names for the same role?

There is a lot of discussion going on, where some people are asking whether platform engineering replaces DevOps. Many people say it goes hand in hand and is rather an addition to DevOps, but in reality it's a bit more complicated than that. Platform engineering actually changes a lot of established rules we knew about DevOps, SRE and Cloud engineering, it changes the game and introduces some new rules.\n\nSo let's clearly define, what platform engineering exactly is, more interestingly, why was there even a need for this new role and how it evolved and of course how it compares to DevOps and Cloud engineering and does it really replace any of these roles?\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac T I M E S T A M P S \u23f0  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n0:00 - Intro and Overview\n0:50 - Why Platform Engineering?

        "videoDescription":"In this video, Seth Vargo and Liz Fong-Jones discuss how the SRE discipline reduces tension over velocity\/stability between product teams and system operators by quantifying risk and employing error budgets. Striving for 100% availability in a service isn't just impossible, it's unnecessary. Maximizing stability limits how quickly new features can be delivered to users. Extreme availability produces diminishing returns as user experience becomes dominated by less reliable components like cellular networks or WiFi. While we want to reduce the risk of system failure, we also have to accept risk in order to deliver new products and features.\n\nIn the SRE discipline, error budgets are the prescriptive, quantitative measurements for how much risk a service is willing to tolerate. Error budgets are the byproduct of the agreed-upon SLOs (Service Level Objectives) between product owners and systems engineers. Risk and error budgets are directly related to many DevOps principles. Error budgets clearly define that \"accidents are normal\" by quantifying accidents and risk. Error budgets also enforce that \"change should be gradual\", because non-gradual changes could quickly break the SLO and prevent further development for the quarter. This is why we say class SRE implements DevOps.\n\n\"Embracing Risk\" in the O'Reilly SRE Book: https:\/\/goo.gl\/kNpXrt\n\"How to Prioritize and Communicate Risks\" on the GCP Blog: https:\/\/goo.gl\/ffmU69\n\nReach out to Liz and Seth:\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/sethvargo\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/lizthegrey\n\nWatch more episodes from the playlist here: https:\/\/goo.gl\/CKv3tV\nSubscribe to the Google Cloud Platform channel for more Cloud content: https:\/\/goo.gl\/S0AS51",

        "videoDescription":"In this video, learn how to create a test plan in Azure DevOps to use with the Regression suite automation tool (RSAT). RSAT helps you automate acceptance testing of your Finance and Operations apps and significantly reduces the time and cost of user acceptance testing (UAT).  \n\nUAT is typically required before you take a Microsoft application update, or before you apply custom code and configurations to your production environment. RSAT also lets functional power users record business tasks by using Task recorder and then convert the recordings into a suite of automated tests, without having to write source code.  \n\nLearn more: https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/dynamics365\/fin-ops-core\/dev-itpro\/perf-test\/rsat\/rsat-overview \n\nThank you for watching our video!

        "videoDescription":"Liz Fong-Jones and Seth Vargo are back again, this time discussing the SRE topic called \"toil\". In the SRE discipline, toil is the kind of work tied to running a production service that tends to be manual, repetitive, automatable, tactical, and devoid of long-term value. Toil tends to scale linearly as the service grows. As such, the SRE discipline strives to reduce toil as much as possible.\n\nToil and toil budgets closely influence the desire to \"measure everything\" and \"leverage tooling and automation\". By giving operators a quantitative measurement, toil and toil budgets ensure a balance between administering the system and improving it. This is why we say class SRE implements DevOps.\n\nEliminating Toil in the O'Reilly SRE Book: https:\/\/goo.gl\/TfwupX\n\nTwitter:\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/sethvargo\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/lizthegrey\n\nclass SRE implements DevOps Playlist: https:\/\/goo.gl\/CKv3tV\nSubscribe to the Google Cloud Platform channel: https:\/\/goo.gl\/S0AS51",

Customer Reliability Engineering (or CRE) at Google is a defined discipline that aims to teach the SRE practices and principles to external organizations. \n\nCRE is closely related to many DevOps principles. CRE focuses on \"reducing organizational silos\", but unlike the traditional definition of reducing the silo within the organization, it focuses on expanding collaboration between users and service providers. Additionally, it relates closely to \"accepting failure as normal\" by setting clear expectations with users about service availability. Lastly, it relates to \"measuring everything\" by sharing service level measurements in a single pane of glass between customers and platform providers. This is why we say class SRE implements DevOps.\n\nIntroducing CRE at Google: https:\/\/goo.gl\/ZXVqff\nGoogle Cloud CRE Blog Posts: https:\/\/goo.gl\/KdhNUy\nWhy you need to SRE your Customers: https:\/\/goo.gl\/tsri5v\n\nReach out to Liz and Seth:\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/sethvargo\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/lizthegrey\n\nWatch more episodes from the playlist here: https:\/\/goo.gl\/CKv3tV\nSubscribe to the Google Cloud Platform channel for more Cloud content: https:\/\/goo.gl\/S0AS51",

We'll use metrics to find slow or erroring queries, traces to find interactions between components, and logs to understand the errors in more detail.\n\nTo get started with this functionality, Google Cloud offers Stackdriver Service Monitoring.\n\nReference Links:\nStackdriver Service Monitoring \u2192  http:\/\/bit.ly\/2p5M0Yx \nDrill down into Stackdriver \u2192 https:\/\/bit.ly\/2wJdVS7\nImproving Reliability with Error Budgets, Metrics, and Tracing in Stackdriver \u2192 https:\/\/bit.ly\/2x8QoKI \n\nReach out to Liz and Seth:\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/sethvargo\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/lizthegrey\n\nWatch more episodes from the playlist here \u2192 http:\/\/bit.ly\/2PPL6f0\nSubscribe to the Google Cloud Platform channel for more Cloud content \u2192 http:\/\/bit.ly\/GCloudPlatform",

Using the example of a friend's mother running a tiffin service, we explore the similarities between the two processes, including recipe\/code development, quality control, and deployment. We also discuss the importance of checking for bugs and ensuring stable features before deployment, and the role of CI\/CD and devops in the build process.\n\n#FrontendDevelopment #BuildProcess #DevOpsInAction #tanaypratap \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike, Share, and Subscribe for more!\n\nFollow me on my other social media handles for all updates, events, and live sessions-\nInstagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/tanaypratap\/\nFacebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tanayofficial\nLinkedIn: https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/tanaypratap\/\nTwitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/tanaypratap\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat's my story? An engineer, in love with his job, started teaching on the side. Got lucky. Impacted 1000s of lives. Had to finally leave his job to increase the impact surface area. Raised $5M funding to fix education. Is learning day and day about startups and building a valuable product. \n\nHow is it going? A decade of engineering helps in systems thinking and product building. Learning about Strategy, Marketing, People Management, and Finance on the go. \n\nWhat am I building? Today, 25 million Indians prepare for government job entrance exams. They do it for years together. The probability of success is less than 1% but they still do it. Why? For the lack of a structured alternative to launch their white-collar career. I am building Invact to bridge this gap. \nHow? Follow me to know, it's a long story. I am telling it in parts every day.",

We also discuss the importance of checking for bugs and ensuring stable features before deployment, and the role of CI\/CD and devops in the build process.\n\n#FrontendDevelopment #BuildProcess #DevOpsInAction #tanaypratap \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike, Share, and Subscribe for more!\n\nFollow me on my other social media handles for all updates, events, and live sessions-\nInstagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/tanaypratap\/\nFacebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tanayofficial\nLinkedIn: https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/tanaypratap\/\nTwitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/tanaypratap\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat's my story? An engineer, in love with his job, started teaching on the side. Got lucky. Impacted 1000s of lives. Had to finally leave his job to increase the impact surface area. Raised $5M funding to fix education. Is learning day and day about startups and building a valuable product. \n\nHow is it going? A decade of engineering helps in systems thinking and product building. Learning about Strategy, Marketing, People Management, and Finance on the go. \n\nWhat am I building? Today, 25 million Indians prepare for government job entrance exams. They do it for years together. The probability of success is less than 1% but they still do it. Why? For the lack of a structured alternative to launch their white-collar career. I am building Invact to bridge this gap. \nHow? Follow me to know, it's a long story. I am telling it in parts every day.",

        "videoDescription":"DevOps Engineer Cherwin Nooitmeer on the complexity of Kubernetes and the future of DevOps.\n\n\u201cThe future of DevOps is going to be boring\u201d\n\nWhat is DevOps?\nThere are programmers that write software that need to run on computers, we call them servers. And when a programmer writes software, someone needs to put that software on the computers. So people like you and me can access facebook.com and see pictures of cats. Right?\n\nThe process from getting the software from a developer to one of the computers that Facebook has, because you can imagine, they have a lot of them. How you do that, that is where DevOps comes in.\n\nSo you write software and you have to put it in production. The gap in between, that's where my focus is. And I try to reduce that gap, so it's instant basically.\n\nWhy DevOps?\nCompanies have started to realize, if you have good DevOps processes you can deliver value to the customer faster. You can just outperform all competitors.\n\nWhat\u2019s the future of DevOps?\nThe future of DevOps, I hope, from my perspective, is going to be boring. DevOps will develop and become more mature. We will get better tools and better ways of doing things, like testing and doing infrastructure in a way that is reliable and fast. Hopefully, my job will be as a commodity so I can work on other things and add even more value to customers.\n\nWhat is Kubernetes?\nSo what we need to do is to make sure we can run software, that we can update it, roll back things, etcetera. These are similar things that every company needs to do.\n\nSo Google came and they basically understood and standardized the way of rolling out software and deploying it to users, making sure everything works fine. They basically extracted their learnings into a product. And that product is Kubernetes. People like I use Kubernetes to build platforms so we can enable companies to deliver value to customers faster.\n\nWhat I do think about Kubernetes is that when people see it, they see it\u2019s awesome and they all try to use it. I think that's a mistake.\n\nIs the hype real?\nThere\u2019s a lot of hype around Kubernetes. But Kubernetes also adds a lot of complexity. And I think the complexity gets overshadowed by the hype. People think it\u2019s fine and it just works and you can use it.\n\nBut what I do think, this complexity that is there is necessary. Because if you are not going to use the complexity of Kubernetes, you are going to create your own system that you need to maintain and develop. Because it's not only software that we use to service users. You also need to write software to service the servers, if that makes any sense. Right?\n\nAnd if you are going to write it yourself. What happens if you hire a new guy? Now you have to explain to the new guy how your complexity works. So instead of using a complexity that everyone knows, you\u2019re going to create your own complexity. And now you have to teach everybody about your own complexity. And then you need to maintain it.\n\nSo this is a trade-off, what are you going to do? I mean, if you have a very simple problem and can get away with having less complexity. Then maybe Kubernetes is not the right thing for you.\n\nCoder Society is a professional community of senior freelance developers, designers, and product managers.\n\nJoin our journey: https:\/\/codersociety.com\n#Kubernetes #k8s #DevOps",

In the present-day scenario of IT organizations, DevOps Engineer is one of the most demanding job profiles with no signs of slowing down. No wonder DevOps will rule the IT world in the upcoming times! If you\u2019re looking forward to making a career as a DevOps Engineer, this video is for you.\n\n***FREE WEEK SEP 19-25***\nACCESS TO ALL FREE PREMIUM COURSE: https:\/\/kode.wiki\/FREECOURSE_YT\n\nVisit our learning path at https:\/\/bit.ly\/DevOpsLearningPath-YT\n\nThis video consists of the following:\n00:00 - Introduction\n00:35 - What is DevOps?\n01:38 - What does a DevOps Engineer do?\n03:26 - Why is there a great demand for DevOps?\n03:56 - What do you need to know?\n04:25 - Linux operating system, scripting and networking\n04:58 - Git Version Control\n05:23 - A Programming Language (Python or Go)\n05:59 - CI\/CD Deployment tools\n06:21 - Containers and Orchestration\n06:48 - How do you get started?\n08:37 - Conclusion\n\nThose new to the Cloud and DevOps world often find it challenging to start their journey due to the missing basic prerequisites. For example, issues with setting up a basic lab environment using VirtualBox, problems with networking, or trouble with working with the Linux CLI or text editors like vi editor. Sometimes there are issues with applications - like getting a sample application to work, problems with getting the dependencies to install correctly or trouble with getting a web server to communicate with a database server. Or, at other times, it's working with data formats like JSON or YAML.\n\nSo we have identified a gap, and we believe that this is due to missing some of the basic prerequisites, such as knowing the basics of Linux, the basics of tools like VirtualBox, or knowing the basics of the most commonly used applications like Java, Python or NodeJS or web servers like Apache, NGINX etc. As a DevOps or Cloud Engineer, it is crucial to have these basics cleared. And that\u2019s why we are helping you to bridge that gap!\n\nWant to view a clear path to becoming a DevOps Engineer?

        "videoDescription":"This video captures my presentation delivered at the DevOps Meetup in Z\u00fcrich on January 25, 2024, where I delve into the prevalent challenges faced by traditional DevOps methodologies, characterized by isolated teams and fragmented value streams that impede efficiency. It explores DevOps as a holistic culture, mindset, and suite of technical practices designed to foster continuous value delivery, prioritize products over projects, and focus on customer-centric development. Additionally, I introduce Platform Engineering as a strategic evolution of DevOps aimed at mitigating the technical and operational complexities encountered when scaling DevOps in larger enterprises. Highlighting a collaborative project with LGT and Z\u00fchlke, I present the Platform Plane case study, demonstrating how an internal developer platform can streamline and standardize DevOps processes across various teams, thereby reducing cognitive load and enhancing productivity. This presentation goes beyond theoretical discussion, offering a hands-on demonstration of the Platform Plane and its functionalities, including Kubernetes as a service, API gateway, and Service Mesh, among others. It illustrates the vital role of Platform Engineering in enabling product teams to adopt DevOps more efficiently and effectively, leading to an optimized development lifecycle.\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac T I M E S T A M P S \u23f0  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n00:00 Intro\n00:08 Welcome\n00:31 About me\n02:36 Today's challenges\n04:33 DevOps is here to help\n05:20 Who is DevOps?\n06:44 The Benefit of DevOps\n08:05 DevOps is bullshit?\n08:27 What are the Challenges with DevOps?\n08:59 You build it you run it\n10:18 Think about that on scale.\n11:06 Can you scale DevOps?\n11:23 Example of What companies want\n15:50 The Digital Factory \n16:35 Platform Engineering Enables DevOps in Product Teams.\n18:30 The Gartner Top Strategic Technology Trends for 2024. \n19:29 Platform Engineering Improves DevOps Efficiency.\n20:24 The Platform Plane: Big Picture.\n22:04 The Platform Plane: High Level Architecture\n21:56 Demo 1 - The Admin Areas\n25:56 Demo 2 - Platform Plane\n26:01 Platform Plane- Main page\n26:27 Documentations\n27:38 AI Assistant\n29:21 Platform plane:\n30:12 - GitLab\n30:44 - Repositories \n32:13 - Registry\n33:40 - Package Management\n36:42 - Hypervisor ( virtual machines)\n36:52 - Identity \n37:56- Chat\n39:07 Summary\n39:45 Outro\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac  L I N K S  \ud83d\udd17\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nPlatform Plane: \n\u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/rSUI6-R4DlM\n\nLGT: \n\u27a4 https:\/\/www.lgt.com\/\n\nZ\u00fchlke: \n\u27a4 https:\/\/www.zuehlke.com\/\n\nDevOps Meetup Z\u00fcrich: \n\u27a4 https:\/\/www.meetup.com\/devops-meetup-zurich\/\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Want to learn more? \ud83d\ude80  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \n\nYou're developing products, not projects \n\u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/ImbhUFr6suw?si=UeSOAR67hZcJWE5T\n\nDevOps \n\u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/Ath3XoLbYxY?si=xzJzs4Fqpst6uxqm\n\nApply continous testing and build-in quality \n\u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/W0QZRpf7ElM?si=oe54rFG0uEXtHUbJ\n\nApply continous security \n\u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/340YmM08Eb0?si=QFOGkCnUElDXevR-\n\nBuild a platform\n \u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/UE8mSt55xHw?si=cc6_S_6Wv6iwA_y1\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac  S U B S C R I B E  \ud83d\udd14 \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \n\u2554\u2550\u2566\u2557\u2554\u2566\u2557\u2554\u2550\u2566\u2550\u2566\u2566\u2566\u2566\u2557\u2554\u2550\u2557\n\u2551\u255a\u2563\u2551\u2551\u2551\u255a\u2563\u255a\u2563\u2554\u2563\u2554\u2563\u2551\u255a\u2563\u2550\u2563\n\u2560\u2557\u2551\u255a\u255d\u2551\u2551\u2560\u2557\u2551\u255a\u2563\u2551\u2551\u2551\u2551\u2551\u2550\u2563\n\u255a\u2550\u2569\u2550\u2550\u2569\u2550\u2569\u2550\u2569\u2550\u2569\u255d\u255a\u2569\u2550\u2569\u2550\u255d\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCXvlc9x4zlv5DEqbby55Ivg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Connect with me \ud83d\udc4b  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nLINKEDIN                  \u25ba https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/romanoroth\/\nTWITTER                   \u25ba https:\/\/twitter.com\/RomanoRoth\nINSTAGRAM             \u25ba https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/romanoroth\/\nFACEBOOK               \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/romanoroth\/\nMEETUP                   \u25ba https:\/\/www.meetup.com\/de-DE\/DevOps-Meetup-Zurich\/\nCONFERNCE            \u25bahttps:\/\/www.devopsdays.ch\/\nHOMEPAGE              \u25ba  https:\/\/www.romanoroth.com\/\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac  P L A Y L I S T S  \u25b6\ufe0f \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nModern Software Engineering\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLrsbMazVPK_rb56rZQr2fyBGR3cyanZpX\nDevOps\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLrsbMazVPK_ro3fn1G-3Ui2mBPHxOD9kF\nGitLab: Build a DevSecOps Pipeline\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLrsbMazVPK_qhf3ahA_zRPlwBaGGhSu2P\n\n#devsecops  #devops #romanoroth #platformengineering",

No \ud83d\ude09.\nDon't panic and check out the talk \ud83c\udf9e I had with Pia Wiedermayer on this topic.\n\nIs DevOps really the reason why testing and quality assurance (QA) employees are being increasingly automated out of a job?\nPia Wiedermayer, Head of QA, and Romano Roth, Head of DevOps, discuss different ways to incorporate the wealth of experience of testing and QA specialists into the agile team culture.\n\nInsight: \n- DevOps is often equated with automation\n- What does this mean for people in these roles and with these responsibilities?\n- Testers offer a wealth of experience that can be incorporated into the\nagile team culture\n\nSoftware testing and quality assurance are changing. Topics such as agility, DevOps and automation strongly influence existing roles and areas of responsibility in software quality assurance as well as during the entire software life cycle. Standard testing and QA roles no longer exist in many (project) organisations. Dedicated testing teams are increasingly a thing of the past.\n\nWhat does this mean for people in these roles and with these responsibilities? Is there no room for them anymore? Are their skills and expertise no longer needed?\n\nDevOps is often equated with automation. Is DevOps responsible for automating employees out of a job? What is behind the hype and who or what is DevOps actually?\n\nPia Wiedermayer, Head of Quality Assurance https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/piawiedermayer\/, and Romano Roth, Head of DevOps, at Z\u00fchlke Switzerland tackle these questions. They talk about the challenges in their projects, examine roles and tasks and reveal new paths for professional and personal development. They also discuss ways to incorporate the wealth of experience of testers into the agile team culture and whether automation is the new testing.\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac T I M E S T A M P S \u23f0  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n00:00 Introduction\n00:19 How is your project?\n01:18 How was it in the past? \n01:53 How is it today? \n02:53 Does DevOps help?\n03:23 What do you think about that? \n03:49 What is DevOps?\n04:33 Who is DevOps? \n05:00 Your role in the past\n05:26 Your role in the future\n06:06 How to automate? \n08:00 1. Quality assurace and the corresponding skills are integral parts of every step in the DevOps cycle\n08:13 2. Enable the team to improve quality.

Request only private parallel jobs unless you have a valid reason for public jobs.\n\nApproval Timeframe: It typically takes 24 to 48 hours for Microsoft to approve parallel job requests.\n\nVerification: After approval, you can verify the availability of parallel jobs in the Azure DevOps portal under the \"Parallel Jobs\" section in the billing settings.\n\nBilling Setup for Additional Jobs: For additional parallel jobs, users need an active Azure subscription (e.g., Pay-As-You-Go), and setup billing, linking it to the Azure subscription. This will allow for purchasing more parallel jobs if needed.\n\n\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83c\udfeb This complete tutorial is compiled by Sandeep Soni, a Microsoft Certified Trainer, a Software & Corporate Trainer for 27years!  \nFor more Training Courses Visit: https:\/\/www.bestitcourses.com\n\n\ud83d\udcf2 \ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf0\ud835\ude01 \ud835\ude04\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf5 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff\ud83d\udc4b \nCall Sandeep Soni for Career Guidance \u25ba +91 98490 01840 \nConnect with me on LINKEDIN \u25ba https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/sandeepsoni123\/ \n \n\ud83d\udc4d \ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb'\ud835\ude01 \ud835\uddd9\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf4\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude01 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddfc \n- Like the video if you found it helpful. \n- Subscribe to our channel for more DevOps tutorials and certification guides. \n- Hit the bell icon to get notified of our latest videos. \n\n\ud83d\udcac Join the Conversation \nHave questions or need further clarification?

Sometimes there are issues with applications - like getting a sample application to work, problems with getting the dependencies to install correctly or trouble with getting a web server to communicate with a database server. Or, at other times, it's working with data formats like JSON or YAML.\n\nSo we have identified a gap, and we believe that this is due to missing some of the basic prerequisites, such as knowing the basics of Linux, the basics of tools like VirtualBox, or knowing the basics of the most commonly used applications like Java, Python or NodeJS or web servers like Apache, NGINX etc. As a DevOps or Cloud Engineer, it is crucial to have these basics cleared. And that\u2019s why we are helping you to bridge that gap!\n\nWant to view a clear path to becoming a DevOps Engineer?

        "videoDescription":"Microservices have significantly increased operations complexity and security footprints. Even a small infrastructure with 50 virtual machines comprises tens of microservices consuming dozens of cloud provider platform-as-a-service services. Developer productivity can be hindered by DevSecOps teams who block developer self-service to avoid security risks. Developers raising support tickets to DevSecOps may wait days for responses. Organizations that allow developers unfettered access risk the security of their cloud infrastructure. Today, organizations face the challenge of creating self-service automation that can abstract DevOps and security nuance, so that developers can focus on their applications. In other words: DevOps as a service.

        "videoDescription":"Today we'll be discussing the differences between DevOps and platform engineering. \n\nThere are various definitions for DevOps and Platform Engineering. This video will be mainly based on my experiences as software engineer working in the DevOps\/platform engineering space for the past few years.\n\nDevOps is a set of practices that aims to bridge the gap between development (dev) and operations (ops) teams. The goal is to improve collaboration, and not have two silos with the dev team sitting on one side and the ops team sitting on the other.\n\nSo I have always seen devops as a mindset and just another fancy way of saying software engineer.\nFor me the goal has always been to build cross-functional teams to reduce dependencies in organisations.\nThis concept has been popularised by the AWS mantra \"You build it you run it\" where you have the need for teams with T shaped or even better V shaped engineers.\n\nThe DevOps approach works well but when you start having several teams each implementing different ways of going to production you are solving the same problem multiple times.\nAlso these solutions need to be maintained and it's a full time job.\n\nPlatform engineering focuses on building and maintaining the infrastructure and the systems that supports applications and services. \nTheir goal is to support developers in the organisation by creating and maintaining the platform. Developers are the consumers and customers of the platform (Product).\n\nIDP stands for internal developer platform.

Because your developers can access it using their personal accounts, which are not tied to a corporate identity. That makes it difficult for IT to control access. And because contributors can sign the author field of a commit with anything they like, IT can\u2019t track who is really authoring these commits.\n\nJust as bad, contributors are committing code on unauthorized machines, often without even logging into the Git web service, evading all access controls.\n\nThis leaves your software components vulnerable to unauthorized access and tampering, which can lead to malicious code getting distributed to all of your clients.\n\nWith Secure DevOps by Beyond Identity, you can ensure that only your developers check in code to your repo.

Platform Engineering focusses on the building the infrastructure and the systems that are needed for running your applications and supporting your application throughout the software life cycle. So,  the goal  is to support the developers in the organisation and treat them as customers. That\u2019s why we have in platform engineering the concept of IDP Internal developer platform.\n \nSo, this platform is treated as an actual product and the customers of the product are the developers.\nWhat is the role of the IDP?\nIt is to create a thin layer on top of the toolchain that is used inside the organisation to standardise the processes and help developers to have one way to deploy into production\n\nWHO AM I:\nHey friends, welcome to my YouTube channel  @outofdevops  .

        "videoDescription":"In this series we will learn the concepts of DevOps from a perspective of developers. How can these concepts help us be better developers and managers in our day to day jobs. In a startup you might need to fill the shoes of a DevOps, in a big company you might need to communicate with a DevOps team that has wildly different ideas.\n\nWe will gain a different perspective and understanding of the entire process by leaving our comfort zone and focusing on the wider picture. We will learn about different disciplines such as platform engineering and so much more.\n\nIn the first installment we discuss version control. As developers, we see it as a tool to collaborate and save our code. To track our mistakes and changes. In this video we learn why it's a crucial nexus point with the DevOps team and how we can work better to enable that.\n\n\u2705  You can see the article that goes with this post here: https:\/\/debugagent.com\/devops-for-developers-introduction-and-version-control\n\n\u2705  Check out the full series in the blog here: https:\/\/debugagent.com\/series\/devops4dev\n\n\u2705  Check out the playlist for this series here: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2HatFLh4xoA&list=PL8GhfcywW9YOA5i7kEFdNYFuluotS2JTZ\n\n\u2705  Check out https:\/\/debugagent.com\/ for other great content.\n\nTitle: DevOps 4 Devs-Introduction: Basic DevOps Tools & Version Control | git\n\n===============================\n\n\u2705  Subscribe To Channel For More Great Content on debugging and programming: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@debugagent \n\n\u2705  Stay Connected With Me.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Twitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/debugagent \n\ud83d\udc49 LinkedIn: https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/shai-almog-81a42\/ \n\ud83d\udc49 Website: https:\/\/debugagent.com\/ \n\ud83d\udc49 GitHub: https:\/\/github.com\/shai-almog \n\ud83d\udc49 Mastodon: https:\/\/mastodon.social\/@debugagent \n\n=============================\n\n\u2705  Recommended Playlists: \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Practical Debugging at Scale Course - Module 1: \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=A919j_5qE0k&list=PL8GhfcywW9YM3OsfxnaxAci6dJgkuOQWn \n\n\u2705  Other Videos You Might Be Interested In Watching: \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Practical Debugging at Scale Part 3: Watch and Evaluate   \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DGjVVKCNosM \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Practical Debugging at Scale Part 2: Program Control Flow   \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=GSeg5L31XXw \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Practical Debugging at Scale Part 1: Introduction   \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=A919j_5qE0k \n\n=============================\n\n\ud83d\udd14 Subscribe to our channel for more videos on debugging and programming: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@debugagent \n\n=================================\n\nDisclaimer: We do not accept any liability for any loss or damage which is incurred from you acting or not acting as a result of listening to any of our publications.

To learn more check out https:\/\/debugagent.com\/\n\nThis channel contains videos that comprise the first module covering debugging. Here we focus on IntelliJ\/IDEA and  Java\/JVM but the basic logic and tooling should be applicable to many other IDEs and platforms. We discuss debugging features that are niche and often unknown e.g.:\n\n* Marker Objects\n* Entry Renderers\n* Instance tracking\n* Memory object inspection\n* Tracepoints\/Logpoints\n\nand much more!\n\nBy leveraging these tools and techniques you will gain access to the secret weapon of senior developers and consultants. This will make you a better developer and a happier one. \n\nIn the following modules we cover:\n* Debugging Theory\n* Tooling\n* Writing Debuggable Code\n* Kubernetes (k8s)\n* Serverless\n* Fullstack\n* Observability \n\nThe full course includes more than 5 hours of video material.",

Over the past 1.5 years, I have been leveraging the power of podcasts to achieve this goal, inviting experienced professionals in the field to share their knowledge and insights with my audience.  My main agenda with this initiative is to build a testing mindset among students, as I believe that this is a crucial skill in today's software development landscape. By targeting those from less privileged backgrounds and areas, I hope to bridge the gap in knowledge and exposure to this field, opening up new opportunities for growth and development.

        "videoDescription":"In this talk, Peter explores the evolution of #DevOps and introduces the concept of full-stack #platformengineering. While DevOps promised to bridge the gap between development and operations, it often resulted in Ops teams scripting infrastructure without applying key software engineering principles. Platform engineering takes this further by treating infrastructure as a product, raising the abstraction level, and enabling developers with scalable, reusable solutions. Peter will explain how they made this shift at Carlsberg and why the future of infrastructure lies in full-stack platform engineers who can think like developers and build for the future.\n\n----\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nPeter Birkholm Buch is a senior technology leader with over 35 years of experience in software engineering, architecture, and cloud computing. As the Head of Software Engineering at Carlsberg, Peter leads a global team of 75 engineers across Portugal, Malaysia, and the Philippines. His expertise lies in driving innovation through cloud-based solutions, platform engineering, and the alignment of DevOps practices. Peter is passionate about improving #DeveloperExperience and ensuring compliance and governance across large-scale engineering teams. He has a unique ability to blend strategy with hands-on technical leadership, making him a sought-after speaker and thought leader in the industry.\n\n----\n\n\ud83d\udc47 Learn more:\nhttps:\/\/www.thedevopsconference.com\/stockholm?utm_campaign=The%20DevOps%20Conference%20Scandinavia%202024&utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social&utm_content=youtube_link_stockholm_2024\n\nIf you want to learn more about platform engineering, check out our page here:\nhttps:\/\/www.eficode.com\/platform-engineering?utm_campaign=DevOps&utm_content=185343467&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin&hss_channel=lis-mAqfpCJwjQ\n\n----\n00:00 Intro  \n00:14 Introduction to the speaker and Carlsberg  \n02:30 The story of Carlsberg  \n05:17 Elevating DevEx and GitHub  \n09:03 Security  \n11:44 A new era in infrastructure management  \n16:26 Audience questions  \n19:25 The rise of full-stack platform engineering  \n21:28 Final words  \n21:47 Outro",

This session focused on how architecture-driven Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and InnerSourcing can transform the way DevOps teams build, share, and manage infrastructure at scale.\n\nKey Takeaways:\nInnerSourcing with Custom Terraform Modules \u2013 We introduced custom Terraform modules built on InnerSourcing principles, enabling teams to collaborate and contribute to a shared infrastructure codebase. By applying open-source methodologies within an organization, DevOps teams gain flexibility, efficiency, and reusability while reducing silos.\n\nView Permissions in User Management \u2013 Security and governance are critical in modern DevOps workflows. This feature allows granular access control, ensuring that only the right people have visibility into specific resources, balancing security with operational efficiency.\n\nThe Future of Infrastructure Collaboration \u2013 As organizations scale, having a decentralized but structured approach to infrastructure management is key. We discussed how InnerSourcing, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and DevOps best practices can help teams move faster while maintaining control.\n\nKeywords: DevOps, InnerSourcing, Infrastructure as Code, IaC, Terraform, cloud automation, platform engineering, security and governance, DevOps collaboration, access management, software development\n\nChapters:\n\n0:00 - Intro\n3:15 - InnerSourcing with Custom Terraform Modules\n25:21 - View Permissions in User Management\n29:46 - Q\/A and more\n\n\n#infrastructuremanagement  #devops  #OfficeHours #Reduceddowntime #securityupdates s #rbac  #ProjectTemplates #ContainerRegistries #cloudnative  #techwebinar",
