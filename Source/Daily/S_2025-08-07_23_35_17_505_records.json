In this video, Liz and Seth discuss the differences and similarities between DevOps and SRE, ultimately realizing that DevOps and SRE aren't two competing methods, but rather close friends designed help break down organizational barriers to deliver better software faster. DevOps is like an abstract class in programming, and SRE is one possible implementation of that class.\n\nSite Reliability Engineering: https:\/\/goo.gl\/aCiiPV\nHow SRE relates to DevOps: https:\/\/goo.gl\/NWKuj9\nManaging Deployments with Kubernetes Engine Qwiklab: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2zdFQh5\n\nReach out to Liz and Seth:\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/sethvargo\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/lizthegrey\n\nWatch more episodes from the playlist here: https:\/\/goo.gl\/CKv3tV\nSubscribe to the Google Cloud Platform channel for more Cloud content: https:\/\/goo.gl\/S0AS51",

It has become a buzzword within days of its release and professionals in all fields, especially in high skilled areas like lawyers, doctors, engineers are questioning whether such AI can actually replace them and work.\n\nSo in this video I want to talk about what ChatGPT is and how it even popped up, talk a bit about the organization behind GPT called \"OpenAI\", which has already created many other machine learning models besides Chat GPT and also explain technically about all that.\nAnd then we'll dive in and actually put ChatGPT to use for some DevOps related tasks.\nI really want to see how it can help in generating configuration code for building DevOps processes or different parts of those processes and how well it knows different DevOps technologies, but not just some shallow examples or boilerplate code that I can get from official documentation, but instead also try more fine-tuning and small optimizations in that configuration code.\n\nWe're also going to check out an open source command line tool that is built on top of ChatGPT and was specifically created for engineers to generate infrastructure as code templates and more and finally we'll talk about the impact of ChatGPT, the quality and usefulness of such a tool for engineers and whether it will really replace the engineers and to what extent you should be concerned.\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac T I M E S T A M P S \u23f0  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n00:00 - Intro and Overview\n01:39 - What is ChatGPT, Who developed ChatGPT\n06:45 - Sign Up on ChatGPT\n09:23 - Create Dockerfile for Node.js app using ChatGPT\n22:13 - Create Kubernetes manifest file using ChatGPT\n35:06 - Create CI\/CD pipeline code using ChatGPT\n50:06 - Convert Jenkinsfile into GitLab CI config file\n53:53 - Tools built on top of OpenAI's API\n55:01 - AIaC demo - CLI tool for DevOps\n01:01:00 - My opinion on ChatGPT & whether ChatGPT will replace engineers\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Want to learn more? \ud83d\ude80  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nFull Python course                                            \u25ba  https:\/\/youtu.be\/t8pPdKYpowI\nFull Docker course                                            \u25ba  https:\/\/youtu.be\/3c-iBn73dDE\nFull K8s course                                                  \u25ba  https:\/\/youtu.be\/X48VuDVv0do\nDevOps Tools explained                                   \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/2W9UEq6\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Connect with me \ud83d\udc4b   \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nINSTAGRAM             \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/2F3LXYJ\nTWITTER                   \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/3i54PUB\nLINKEDIN                  \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/3hWOLVT\nFB group                   \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/32UVSZP\nDEV                            \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/3h2fqiO\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Courses & Ebooks & Bootcamp \ud83d\ude80      \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \n\u25ba Become a DevOps Engineer - full educational program             \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc   https:\/\/bit.ly\/45mXaer\n\u25ba High-Quality and Hands-On Courses                                             \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc   https:\/\/bit.ly\/3BNS8Kv\n\u25ba Kubernetes 101 - compact and easy-to-read ebook bundle      \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc   https:\/\/bit.ly\/3Ozl28x",

But there is a lot of mix up of these two roles and many people and many companies often use them interchangeably. They mix the tasks and responsibilities of these two very often. For example there are plenty of job descriptions for \"DevOps Cloud Engineer\" or \"Cloud DevOps Engineer\", which would naturally make you think that they are the same role, but then why would you have two names for the same role?

There is a lot of discussion going on, where some people are asking whether platform engineering replaces DevOps. Many people say it goes hand in hand and is rather an addition to DevOps, but in reality it's a bit more complicated than that. Platform engineering actually changes a lot of established rules we knew about DevOps, SRE and Cloud engineering, it changes the game and introduces some new rules.\n\nSo let's clearly define, what platform engineering exactly is, more interestingly, why was there even a need for this new role and how it evolved and of course how it compares to DevOps and Cloud engineering and does it really replace any of these roles?\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac T I M E S T A M P S \u23f0  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n0:00 - Intro and Overview\n0:50 - Why Platform Engineering?

In this video, we're sharing the top 5 DevOps certifications that are likely to be in high demand in 2023.\nDevOps certifications are one of the best ways to show hiring managers that you're qualified for a technical position. They're also a great way to set yourself up for more advanced career opportunities.\n\n\n\nIn this video we will cover the following topics:\n\n00:00 -  Introduction\n01:42 - Why Certifications are Important\n03:35 - Python Certification\n05:30 - Docker\n06:15 - Kubernetes\n08:22 - Terraform\n08:57 - Linux\n10:16 - Conclusion\n\nWant to view a clear path to becoming a DevOps Engineer? Visit our website - www.kodekloud.com\nWe have various Learning Paths to help you choose your next step and shape your DevOps Career. \n\nCheck out our learning paths at KodeKloud to get started:\n\n -Linux: https:\/\/bit.ly\/LinuxLearningPath\n- DevOps Learning Path: https:\/\/bit.ly\/DevOpsLearningPath-YT\n -Docker: https:\/\/bit.ly\/DockerLearningPath\n -Kubernetes: https:\/\/bit.ly\/KubernetesLearningPath\n -Infrastructure as Code(IAC): https:\/\/bit.ly\/IACLearningPath\n -Programming: https:\/\/bit.ly\/ProgrammingLearningPath\n\n \nThose new to the Programming and DevOps world often find it challenging to start their journey due to the missing basic prerequisites. For example, issues with setting up a basic lab environment using VirtualBox, problems with networking, or trouble with working with the Linux CLI or text editors like vi editor. Sometimes there are issues with applications - like getting a sample application to work, problems with getting the dependencies to install correctly or trouble with getting a web server to communicate with a database server. Or, at other times, it's working with data formats like JSON or YAML.\n\nSo we have identified a gap, and we believe that this is due to missing some of the basic prerequisites, such as knowing the basics of Linux, the basics of tools like VirtualBox, or knowing the basics of the most commonly used applications like Java, Python or NodeJS or web servers like Apache, NGINX etc. As a DevOps or Cloud Engineer, it is crucial to have these basics cleared. And that\u2019s why we are helping you to bridge that gap!\n\nFor more updates on courses and tips, follow us on:\n-Website: https:\/\/kodekloud.com\/\n-LinkedIn: https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/kode...\n-Twitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/kodekloud1\n-Facebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/kodekloudtra...\n-Instagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/kodekloud\/\n-Blog: https:\/\/kodekloud.com\/blog\/\n\n#itcertifications  #devopscertification #kodekloud",

        "videoDescription":"DevOps engineer and Cloud engineer have similar skills and responsibilities, but their role is pretty distinct. So in this video, we'll compare and contrast the roles of the DevOps engineer and the Cloud engineer, to help you decide which one is right for you. After watching this video, you'll know which one is the right fit for your needs! \n\n\n\nIn this video we will cover the following topics:\n\n00:00 -  Introduction\n01:14 - What is a DevOps Engineer?\n02:44 - What is a Cloud Engineer?\n04:12 - What's the Difference?\n04:42 - How are they valued?\n05:53 - Which one you should consider?\n06:45 - What salary can you expect?\n07:40 - Learning Paths\n\nWant to view a clear path to becoming a DevOps Engineer? Visit our website - https:\/\/bit.ly\/Kodekloud-YT\nWe have various Learning Paths to help you choose your next step and shape your DevOps Career. \n\nCheck out our learning paths at KodeKloud to get started:\n\n -Linux: https:\/\/bit.ly\/LinuxLearningPath\n- DevOps Learning Path: https:\/\/bit.ly\/DevOpsLearningPath-YT\n -Docker: https:\/\/bit.ly\/DockerLearningPath\n -Kubernetes: https:\/\/bit.ly\/KubernetesLearningPath\n -Infrastructure as Code(IAC): https:\/\/bit.ly\/IACLearningPath\n -Programming: https:\/\/bit.ly\/ProgrammingLearningPath\n\n \nThose new to the Programming and DevOps world often find it challenging to start their journey due to the missing basic prerequisites. For example, issues with setting up a basic lab environment using VirtualBox, problems with networking, or trouble with working with the Linux CLI or text editors like vi editor. Sometimes there are issues with applications - like getting a sample application to work, problems with getting the dependencies to install correctly or trouble with getting a web server to communicate with a database server. Or, at other times, it's working with data formats like JSON or YAML.\n\nSo we have identified a gap, and we believe that this is due to missing some of the basic prerequisites, such as knowing the basics of Linux, the basics of tools like VirtualBox, or knowing the basics of the most commonly used applications like Java, Python or NodeJS or web servers like Apache, NGINX etc. As a DevOps or Cloud Engineer, it is crucial to have these basics cleared. And that\u2019s why we are helping you to bridge that gap!\n\nFor more updates on courses and tips, follow us on:\n-Website: https:\/\/kodekloud.com\/\n-LinkedIn: https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/kode...\n-Twitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/kodekloud1\n-Facebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/kodekloudtra...\n-Instagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/kodekloud\/\n-Blog: https:\/\/kodekloud.com\/blog\/\n\n#devopsengineer   #cloudengineer  #kodekloud",

Proper on-device encryption, 2FA codes, logins, secrets - all mine and only mine. No compromises.\n\nThese are partner links - you won\u2019t pay a cent more, but you\u2019ll be supporting DevOps Compass.

We will set up a build pipeline which creates a build artifact that can be used in the Release pipeline. I will set up multiple environments (Dev and Test) and show how to progress the function through the different stages. The Azure Function uses an environment value, which we will set up using Azure Variable groups and pass it as Application settings to Azure infrastructure. \n\nNew to Azure DevOps? \nGet Started here - https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=prqW7DVVxLM\n\nAdditional Watching: \nAzure DevOps Playlist - https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PL59L9XrzUa-m7AFDgjWuwm6exyCklc03U\n\nCome say hi! \u270b\nBlog - https:\/\/rahulpnath.com\/\nTwitter - https:\/\/twitter.com\/rahulpnath\nInstagram - https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/rahulpnath\/\n\nMy YouTube Recording Setup - https:\/\/www.rahulpnath.com\/blog\/youtube_setup_and_workflow\/\n\nMake sure to SUBSCRIBE to the channel.

SSH or Secure Shell is a cryptographic network protocol designed for secure data communication. It is often used in passwordless authentication scenarios, improving the productivity and security of developers.\n\nWorking with Azure DevOps, an all-inclusive suite of development tools provided by Microsoft, can be significantly enhanced by using SSH. Azure DevOps comprises various services including Azure Repos, which is a set of version control tools that help developers manage their code. Azure Repos is versatile in that it supports both Git and Team Foundation Version Control.\n\nOne of the ways to interact with Azure Repos is using Git, a popular open-source version control system. When using Git with Azure Repos, developers have the flexibility to work with their codebase using various Git clients, including the popular VS Code. However, to establish a secure connection between these clients and Azure Repos, proper authentication is crucial.\n\nThis is where SSH comes in. Using SSH, you can authenticate to Azure DevOps, and particularly, Azure Git Repositories, without entering your username and password every time. This not only saves time but also minimizes the risk of your credentials being exposed.\n\nThis guide aims to help developers configure SSH for Azure DevOps, understand how to clone Azure Git Repos using SSH, and embrace passwordless and public key authentication methods for seamless and secure operations. Whether you're an IT professional, software engineer, or someone interested in learning about DevOps, this information will equip you with valuable insights into SSH integration and usage.\n\nThis video is about:-\nSSH Authentication\nAzure DevOps Tutorials\nAzure Repos\nAzure Git Repositories \nVS Code with Azure DevOps\nGit Authentication\nClone Azure Git Repo with SSH\nHow to use SSH authentication with Azure DevOps \nSsh passwordless authentication\nSsh with public key authentication \nUsing SSH to authenticate Git in Azure DevOps\nClone git Repository using SSH in Azure DevOps\n\n#AzureDevOps #git #softwareengineering",

Request only private parallel jobs unless you have a valid reason for public jobs.\n\nApproval Timeframe: It typically takes 24 to 48 hours for Microsoft to approve parallel job requests.\n\nVerification: After approval, you can verify the availability of parallel jobs in the Azure DevOps portal under the \"Parallel Jobs\" section in the billing settings.\n\nBilling Setup for Additional Jobs: For additional parallel jobs, users need an active Azure subscription (e.g., Pay-As-You-Go), and setup billing, linking it to the Azure subscription. This will allow for purchasing more parallel jobs if needed.\n\n\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83c\udfeb This complete tutorial is compiled by Sandeep Soni, a Microsoft Certified Trainer, a Software & Corporate Trainer for 27years!  \nFor more Training Courses Visit: https:\/\/www.bestitcourses.com\n\n\ud83d\udcf2 \ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf0\ud835\ude01 \ud835\ude04\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf5 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff\ud83d\udc4b \nCall Sandeep Soni for Career Guidance \u25ba +91 98490 01840 \nConnect with me on LINKEDIN \u25ba https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/sandeepsoni123\/ \n \n\ud83d\udc4d \ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb'\ud835\ude01 \ud835\uddd9\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf4\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude01 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddfc \n- Like the video if you found it helpful. \n- Subscribe to our channel for more DevOps tutorials and certification guides. \n- Hit the bell icon to get notified of our latest videos. \n\n\ud83d\udcac Join the Conversation \nHave questions or need further clarification?

For example, issues with setting up a basic lab environment using VirtualBox, problems with networking, or trouble with working with the Linux CLI or text editors like vi editor. Sometimes there are issues with applications - like getting a sample application to work, problems with getting the dependencies to install correctly or trouble with getting a web server to communicate with a database server. Or, at other times, it's working with data formats like JSON or YAML.\n\nSo we have identified a gap, and we believe that this is due to missing some of the basic prerequisites, such as knowing the basics of Linux, the basics of tools like VirtualBox, or knowing the basics of the most commonly used applications like Java, Python or NodeJS or web servers like Apache, NGINX etc. As a DevOps or Cloud Engineer, it is crucial to have these basics cleared. And that\u2019s why we are helping you to bridge that gap!\n\nWant to view a clear path to becoming a DevOps Engineer?

Request only private parallel jobs unless you have a valid reason for public jobs.\n\nApproval Timeframe: It typically takes 24 to 48 hours for Microsoft to approve parallel job requests.\n\nVerification: After approval, you can verify the availability of parallel jobs in the Azure DevOps portal under the \"Parallel Jobs\" section in the billing settings.\n\nBilling Setup for Additional Jobs: For additional parallel jobs, users need an active Azure subscription (e.g., Pay-As-You-Go), and setup billing, linking it to the Azure subscription. This will allow for purchasing more parallel jobs if needed.\n\n\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83c\udfeb This complete tutorial is compiled by Sandeep Soni, a Microsoft Certified Trainer, a Software & Corporate Trainer for 27years!  \nFor more Training Courses Visit: https:\/\/www.bestitcourses.com\n\n\ud83d\udcf2 \ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf0\ud835\ude01 \ud835\ude04\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf5 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff\ud83d\udc4b \nCall Sandeep Soni for Career Guidance \u25ba +91 98490 01840 \nConnect with me on LINKEDIN \u25ba https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/sandeepsoni123\/ \n \n\ud83d\udc4d \ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb'\ud835\ude01 \ud835\uddd9\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf4\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude01 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddfc \n- Like the video if you found it helpful. \n- Subscribe to our channel for more DevOps tutorials and certification guides. \n- Hit the bell icon to get notified of our latest videos. \n\n\ud83d\udcac Join the Conversation \nHave questions or need further clarification?

It\u2019s huge right now in the tech community, and it\u2019s definitely becoming more central to how teams build software.\nIf you\u2019re starting with DevOps, this video will help you understand the basics and give you a good head-start on your journey. You will also learn about the different stages in DevOps, what tools are needed at each stage, and how potential problems should be handled.\n\nStart your DevOps Career (Beginners - Advanced) - https:\/\/bit.ly\/DevOpsLearningPath-YT\n\nIn this video we will cover the following topics:\n\n00:00 -  Introduction\n00:27 - Problems before DevOps\n01:33 - Two Stages of DevOps\n02:12 - Real World Scenario 1\n03:28 - Real World Scenario 2\n04:12 - Automation\n05:06 - Benefits of DevOps\n06:10 - Summary\n07:22 - Conclusion\n \nThose new to the Programming and DevOps world often find it challenging to start their journey due to the missing basic prerequisites. For example, issues with setting up a basic lab environment using VirtualBox, problems with networking, or trouble with working with the Linux CLI or text editors like vi editor. Sometimes there are issues with applications - like getting a sample application to work, problems with getting the dependencies to install correctly or trouble with getting a web server to communicate with a database server. Or, at other times, it's working with data formats like JSON or YAML.\n\nSo we have identified a gap, and we believe that this is due to missing some of the basic prerequisites, such as knowing the basics of Linux, the basics of tools like VirtualBox, or knowing the basics of the most commonly used applications like Java, Python or NodeJS or web servers like Apache, NGINX etc. As a DevOps or Cloud Engineer, it is crucial to have these basics cleared. And that\u2019s why we are helping you to bridge that gap!\n\nWant to view a clear path to becoming a DevOps Engineer?

The main focus will be on the new Azure Managed DevOps Agent Pools, what they are, how they work, and why you might want to use them.\n\nWe\u2019ll start by deploying some prerequisites using Terraform, including a virtual network to host our agents. You\u2019ll see how to use the AzAPI provider to get the job done and I\u2019ll walk you through it all, step by step, as we build this Terraform project from scratch.\n\nOnce everything is up and running, we\u2019ll connect our agent to an Azure Pipeline and run a deployment to test it out.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to automate Azure DevOps agent pool provisioning with Terraform and AzAPI, or just want to learn more about CI\/CD in Azure, you\u2019re in the right place.

OPA provides a high-level declarative language that lets us specify policies as code and simple APIs to offload policy decision-making from our software. We can use OPA to enforce policies in microservices, Kubernetes, CI\/CD pipelines, API gateways, and more. \nIn kubernetes, OPA uses admission controllers.\n\nWhat is OPA Gatekeeper?\n\nOPA Gatekeeper is a specialized project providing first-class integration between OPA and Kubernetes.\nOPA Gatekeeper adds the following on top of plain OPA:\n\u25cf An extensible, parameterized policy library.\n\u25cf Native Kubernetes CRDs for instantiating the policy library (aka \u201cconstraints\u201d).\n\u25cf Native Kubernetes CRDs for extending the policy library (aka \u201cconstraint templates\u201d).\n\u25cf Audit functionality.\n\nWhy you need Gatekeeper?\n\nAs a Platform DevOps engineer managing multiple Kubernetes clusters for various projects, you face challenges when users deploy applications without adhering to best practices. Key issues include:\n  1.     Lack of ownership unless users apply labels themselves.\n  2.     No resource limits, leading to high costs.\n  3.     Untrusted images impacting other applications.\n  4.     Security and best practice violations across clusters.\n\nTo address these, we need governance to enforce limits and rules via policies. OPA Gatekeeper can be configured to implement these policies, ensuring best practices are followed.\n\nFollow my mentors too : @PavanElthepu    @MPrashant   @GouravSharma   @cloudwithraj   @AntonPutra   @AbhishekVeeramalla   @kubesimplify   @kshindi   @DevOpsJourney \n\nTags : #prometheus   #secrets #docker  #k8s #kubernetes #cncf #rbac #serverless #grafana #autoscaling #deployment  #opensource #devops #grafana #vault #terraform #kustomize #etcd #controlplane #container #opa #dockerhub #gatekeeper",

It's distributed so people around the world can share code\n2. It does version control\n\nSo, with version control, you can take snapshots of the state of your current code and maintain a history.\n\nBranching is really the third thing. Git branches allow developers to do isolated development and take chances without messing up the main branch.\n\nSo when someone asks me 'What is Git?', that is how I typically respond.",

Platform Engineering focusses on the building the infrastructure and the systems that are needed for running your applications and supporting your application throughout the software life cycle. So,  the goal  is to support the developers in the organisation and treat them as customers. That\u2019s why we have in platform engineering the concept of IDP Internal developer platform.\n \nSo, this platform is treated as an actual product and the customers of the product are the developers.\nWhat is the role of the IDP?\nIt is to create a thin layer on top of the toolchain that is used inside the organisation to standardise the processes and help developers to have one way to deploy into production\n\nWHO AM I:\nHey friends, welcome to my YouTube channel  @outofdevops  .

That's typically the config stuff in the hidden .git folder, including things like:\n\n- Refspec\n-Packfiles\n- The HEAD Pointer\n- Git References\n- Remote References\n- Transfer Protocols\n- Garbage Collector\n- Recovery files\n- Tree Objects\n- Environment variables\n\nHopefully you don't have to get your hands dirty with the Git plumbing too often. It's nice to stick with the Git porcelain.\n\nBut at the same time, plumbers do make a lot of money!",

Their job includes coming up with innovative recipes, testing them, and adding the successful ones to the menu. At the same time, they also prepare food to meet the regular demand of customers who visit the restaurant daily. This dual responsibility of innovation and ongoing service can become overwhelming, especially during busy hours when the kitchen is already at full capacity.\n\nWait staff, on the other hand, focus on delivering the prepared food to customers. Their primary role is to ensure that the food reaches the diners promptly and in perfect condition, keeping the restaurant\u2019s operations running smoothly.\n\nExperimenting with a new dish during peak hours, however, becomes a significant challenge. The process of testing new recipes while maintaining the flow of regular orders often leads to disruptions in the kitchen, causing delays and dissatisfaction among customers.\n\nTo address this, the restaurant hires a kitchen manager. The kitchen manager creates a separate small kitchen dedicated to experimenting with new dishes. This ensures that the chefs can focus on their innovations without interfering with the ongoing operations. Once a dish is perfected, the kitchen manager introduces automation, such as using a conveyor belt, to streamline the cooking process. This allows the new dish to be produced efficiently alongside the existing menu items while ensuring there are no interruptions in serving food to the restaurant's customers.\n\nYes, DevOps engineers are none other than automation experts.\n\n#devops #devopsengineer #careerguidance  #newvlog  #trendingreels \n\nroles and responsibilities devops engineer\ndoes devops engineer need coding\nwhat is devops for beginners\nroles of a devops engineer\njob description of devops engineer\nrequirements for devops engineer\nskills required for devops engineer\ndefinition of devops engineer\n@Ajayhr_01",

HELLO WORLD?  \nCan anybody hear me behind the firewall...?  \n404 soul not found...\n\n(Verse 1) \nPush to prod at 3 A.M.,  \nBrain\u2019s a loop in mayhem,  \nTold myself \u201cjust one more line,\u201d  \nNow it\u2019s been seven sprints of crime.  \n\nGIT RESET --HARD!!\n\nDon\u2019t forget to update your dependencies...  \nYou wrote that logic at 2 A.M... it's trash...  \nKevin force-pushed again...\n\nYou ever deploy a microservice and pray it doesn\u2019t become a macro-disaster?  \nMy Docker container\u2019s the only thing holding me together.  \nI tried therapy once... then Jira assigned me 14 more tickets.  \nMy manager said: \u201cJust estimate in story points.\u201d  \nI said: haa\n\n(Chorus)\nHello world, hello pain,  \nIs this loop recursive or am I insane?  \nFrom Python dreams to Java screams,  \nMy RAM is low... and so are my hopes.\n\nAgile... agile... agile...  \nDeliverable... agile...\n\n(Verse 2) \nNull pointer stabbed me in the back,  \nKubernetes launched a DDoS attack.  \nStack Overflow won\u2019t answer me,  \nEven GPT said: \u201cYo bro, I\u2019d flee.\u201d\n\nBUILD FAILED!!!\n\n(Bridge)\nOne commit to rule them all...  \nOne Slack ping begins my fall...  \nYou're on-call this weekend... forever...\n\nDid you test it?  \nIt works on my machine!  \nKevin deleted the prod DB!  \nWhy is prod even accessible from the dashboard?!  \nHugOps... HugOps... HugOps...\n\nHow did I become this...?  \nI just wanted to build an app that makes cat noises...\n\n(Final Chorus)\nOhhhh HELLO WOOORLD, my sanity\u2019s gone,  \nThese tickets keep respawning at dawn.  \nManager says we\u2019re agile and fast,  \nBut this sprint\u2019s a dumpster fire blast.\n\nNOT ON PROOOOOOD!!\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n\ud83d\udd14 Like what you hear?

        "videoDescription":"If you want to become exceptional at DevOps instead of just competent, you need to discover the mindset that transforms technicians into masters. Most people think it's about learning Kubernetes, mastering CI\/CD pipelines, and deploying the right tools, so they focus on technical skills while missing what truly matters.\n\nBut here's the thing: technical expertise alone won't make you remarkable. It's your dedication to perfecting your craft that creates true mastery. The greatest experts, like Jiro who's been making sushi daily for 80 years straight, understand something most technologists never grasp.\n\nThis is an excerpt from the \ud83c\udf71 DevOps Sushi - Part 1 \ud83c\udfac movie that is now available on https:\/\/makeitwork.tv.

        "videoDescription":"#DevOps has enabled digital transformation. In fifteen years, the way we engineer software has revolutionized. It\u2019s spread Continuous Integration and delivery across the globe, humanized IT culture, automated toil, and paying down technical debt. But it\u2019s nowhere near done. A lot of organizations have hit the ceiling. A wall. The brakes. Stagnated. The promise remains: We can thrive in the digital age, create joy through customer experiences, move fast, be nimble, outcompete, and achieve extraordinary organizational performance. But it needs unlocking. #ValueStreamManagement has hundreds of years of history, but its time is now. Building on everything we\u2019ve learned from DevOps, using the toolchains, pipelines, and rich data sources we\u2019ve created, combining VSM and DevOps means we can see organizations as value-generating enterprises. We can pinpoint the choke points, bottlenecks, and dependencies and quickly apply fixes to optimize flow and value realization.\n\nIn this talk, Helen Beal will share real stories from enterprises she\u2019s worked with on how they\u2019ve relentlessly pursued improvement using VSM and DevOps practices and the outcomes they\u2019ve seen.\n\n----\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nHelen Beal is CEO and Chair of the Value Stream Management Consortium and co-chair of the OASIS Value Stream Management Interoperability Technical Committee. She leads the ambassador program at PeopleCert for the DevOps Institute, ITIL, and PRINCE2. She is also Chair of the DevNetwork DevOps Advisory Board and provides strategic advisory services to DevOps and VSM industry leaders.\n\nHelen authorizes the VSMC's annual State of VSM Reports and Moogsoft's State of Availability Report. She is also a co-author of Investments Unlimited, a book about DevOps and governance published by IT Revolution. She is a DevOps editor for InfoQ and writes for many other online platforms.\n\nHelen hosts the Day-to-Day DevOps webinar series for BrightTalk and speaks on DevOps, AI, and value stream-related topics at industry conferences and corporate events.\n\nShe regularly appears in TechBeacon\u2019s DevOps Top100 lists, was recognized as the Top DevOps Evangelist 2020 in the DevOps Dozen awards, and was a finalist for Computing DevOps Excellence Awards\u2019 DevOps Professional of the Year 2021.\n\nShe serves on advisory and judging boards for many initiatives, including Developer Week, DevOps World, JAX DevOps, and InterOp.\n\n----\n\n\ud83d\udc47 Learn more:\nhttps:\/\/www.thedevopsconference.com\/copenhagen?utm_campaign=The%20DevOps%20Conference%20Scandinavia%202024&utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social&utm_content=youtube_link_copenhagen_2024\n\nIf you want to learn more about DevOps transformations, check out our page here:\nhttps:\/\/www.eficode.com\/devops-transformation\n----\n00:00 Intro\n02:37 Where are we with DevOps?\n13:18 History of VSM\n17:56 What is VSM?\n24:49 Lead time and cycle time\n26:20 Guide to VSM\n28:30 Two dimensions of VSM\n29:51 The Value Cycle\n31:25 The DevOps Toolchain\n39:35 Outro",

A thorough understanding of the quirks of legacy applications is the foundation for a successful migration to more modern infrastructure in DevOps. However, this understanding cuts across various teams, not just the DevOps or SRE team. The security team has to perform a risk assessment, observability has to be in place by the SRE team, infrastructure compatibility, incremental migration strategy, Quality Assurance team needs to perform tests, and Documentation also has to be taken into account. Stakeholders - internal and external ones need to be carried along to manage expectations.\n\nThe approach of working across various teams ensures that all aspects of the migration process are addressed comprehensively, minimising risks and maximising the chances of success. Each team brings its expertise and perspective to the table, contributing to a well-rounded migration strategy. By involving all relevant teams and stakeholders from the outset, potential issues can be identified and addressed early on, leading to a smoother and more efficient migration process.",

These lessons can be applied broadly and shift our thinking to how DevOps extends beyond tech alone. Mental illness is stigmatized and hard to talk about publicly. Doubly so in the tech industry where we assign much of our personal value to our brains. I want to share my struggles with mental health and the lessons I\u2019ve learned from Systems operation and DevOps that have helped me get by and frame my struggle in a manageable way.\n\nI want to start a conversation to:\n\n    Help reduce the stigma of Mental Illness by talking about it\n    Provide some illustration of things that have helped me, so hopefully they can help you\n    Show how the concepts of DevOps have application reaching beyond High Technology\n    Spark further conversation about Mental health in tech\n    Hopefully provide a new group and community for those for whom mental health is a concern",

        "videoDescription":"Laura Santamaria is a lead developer advocate at Dell Technologies. She loves to learn and explain how things work to bridge the gaps in engineering disciplines. Laura sat down with the All Things Open team at DevOpsDays Raleigh to talk about DevOps and system science, organizational change, and learning through meetups and events.\n\n0:00 - Introduction\n0:08 - Welcome Laura Santamaria\n0:58 - Can you share a few key takeaways that you shared with the audience here? \n2:40 - What's happening in DevOps, a topic, a trend, a debate, that people should be aware of?\n4:30 - What's one piece of advice that you want to share with the All Things Open community?\n5:40 - How can people find you on the socials?\n\nKey takeaways\n* if you want to make a transformation stick, if you want to bring changes to your company and make sure that it continues past day one or day zero, you're looking at how to ensure equilibrium across multiple systems within your company.\n\n* The best way to ensure that your change sticks in an organization is to think through a CHAOS thought experiment.\n\n* I think that a lot of people believe that DevOps is old-fashioned and it's kind of not really relevant anymore, but they don't understand that it's not about the tools. It's not about these processes that a lot of people have implemented over time. It's really about the people and about the changes you're trying to make over this course of time.\n\n* Join your local meetup. If you can't find one, make one. It's completely okay to have multiple meetups in a city, but bring them all back because that's really where we learn.\n\n\n###\n\nAbout All Things Open\nAll Things Open is a universe of open source events and platforms designed to educate and connect technologists around the world.
