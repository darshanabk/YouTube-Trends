It has become a buzzword within days of its release and professionals in all fields, especially in high skilled areas like lawyers, doctors, engineers are questioning whether such AI can actually replace them and work.\n\nSo in this video I want to talk about what ChatGPT is and how it even popped up, talk a bit about the organization behind GPT called \"OpenAI\", which has already created many other machine learning models besides Chat GPT and also explain technically about all that.\nAnd then we'll dive in and actually put ChatGPT to use for some DevOps related tasks.\nI really want to see how it can help in generating configuration code for building DevOps processes or different parts of those processes and how well it knows different DevOps technologies, but not just some shallow examples or boilerplate code that I can get from official documentation, but instead also try more fine-tuning and small optimizations in that configuration code.\n\nWe're also going to check out an open source command line tool that is built on top of ChatGPT and was specifically created for engineers to generate infrastructure as code templates and more and finally we'll talk about the impact of ChatGPT, the quality and usefulness of such a tool for engineers and whether it will really replace the engineers and to what extent you should be concerned.\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac T I M E S T A M P S \u23f0  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n00:00 - Intro and Overview\n01:39 - What is ChatGPT, Who developed ChatGPT\n06:45 - Sign Up on ChatGPT\n09:23 - Create Dockerfile for Node.js app using ChatGPT\n22:13 - Create Kubernetes manifest file using ChatGPT\n35:06 - Create CI\/CD pipeline code using ChatGPT\n50:06 - Convert Jenkinsfile into GitLab CI config file\n53:53 - Tools built on top of OpenAI's API\n55:01 - AIaC demo - CLI tool for DevOps\n01:01:00 - My opinion on ChatGPT & whether ChatGPT will replace engineers\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Want to learn more? \ud83d\ude80  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nFull Python course                                            \u25ba  https:\/\/youtu.be\/t8pPdKYpowI\nFull Docker course                                            \u25ba  https:\/\/youtu.be\/3c-iBn73dDE\nFull K8s course                                                  \u25ba  https:\/\/youtu.be\/X48VuDVv0do\nDevOps Tools explained                                   \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/2W9UEq6\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Connect with me \ud83d\udc4b   \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nINSTAGRAM             \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/2F3LXYJ\nTWITTER                   \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/3i54PUB\nLINKEDIN                  \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/3hWOLVT\nFB group                   \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/32UVSZP\nDEV                            \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/3h2fqiO\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Courses & Ebooks & Bootcamp \ud83d\ude80      \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \n\u25ba Become a DevOps Engineer - full educational program             \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc   https:\/\/bit.ly\/45mXaer\n\u25ba High-Quality and Hands-On Courses                                             \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc   https:\/\/bit.ly\/3BNS8Kv\n\u25ba Kubernetes 101 - compact and easy-to-read ebook bundle      \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc   https:\/\/bit.ly\/3Ozl28x",

        "videoDescription":"Differences and Overlaps of Cloud and DevOps Engineer Roles as well as deep dive of Cloud Engineer Tasks and Responsibilities\n\nDevOps engineer and Cloud engineer are 2 popular roles in software engineering. But there is a lot of mix up of these two roles and many people and many companies often use them interchangeably. They mix the tasks and responsibilities of these two very often. For example there are plenty of job descriptions for \"DevOps Cloud Engineer\" or \"Cloud DevOps Engineer\", which would naturally make you think that they are the same role, but then why would you have two names for the same role?

There is a lot of discussion going on, where some people are asking whether platform engineering replaces DevOps. Many people say it goes hand in hand and is rather an addition to DevOps, but in reality it's a bit more complicated than that. Platform engineering actually changes a lot of established rules we knew about DevOps, SRE and Cloud engineering, it changes the game and introduces some new rules.\n\nSo let's clearly define, what platform engineering exactly is, more interestingly, why was there even a need for this new role and how it evolved and of course how it compares to DevOps and Cloud engineering and does it really replace any of these roles?\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac T I M E S T A M P S \u23f0  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n0:00 - Intro and Overview\n0:50 - Why Platform Engineering?

It\u2019s huge right now in the tech community, and it\u2019s definitely becoming more central to how teams build software.\nIf you\u2019re starting with DevOps, this video will help you understand the basics and give you a good head-start on your journey. You will also learn about the different stages in DevOps, what tools are needed at each stage, and how potential problems should be handled.\n\nStart your DevOps Career (Beginners - Advanced) - https:\/\/bit.ly\/DevOpsLearningPath-YT\n\nIn this video we will cover the following topics:\n\n00:00 -  Introduction\n00:27 - Problems before DevOps\n01:33 - Two Stages of DevOps\n02:12 - Real World Scenario 1\n03:28 - Real World Scenario 2\n04:12 - Automation\n05:06 - Benefits of DevOps\n06:10 - Summary\n07:22 - Conclusion\n \nThose new to the Programming and DevOps world often find it challenging to start their journey due to the missing basic prerequisites. For example, issues with setting up a basic lab environment using VirtualBox, problems with networking, or trouble with working with the Linux CLI or text editors like vi editor. Sometimes there are issues with applications - like getting a sample application to work, problems with getting the dependencies to install correctly or trouble with getting a web server to communicate with a database server. Or, at other times, it's working with data formats like JSON or YAML.\n\nSo we have identified a gap, and we believe that this is due to missing some of the basic prerequisites, such as knowing the basics of Linux, the basics of tools like VirtualBox, or knowing the basics of the most commonly used applications like Java, Python or NodeJS or web servers like Apache, NGINX etc. As a DevOps or Cloud Engineer, it is crucial to have these basics cleared. And that\u2019s why we are helping you to bridge that gap!\n\nWant to view a clear path to becoming a DevOps Engineer?
