It has become a buzzword within days of its release and professionals in all fields, especially in high skilled areas like lawyers, doctors, engineers are questioning whether such AI can actually replace them and work.\n\nSo in this video I want to talk about what ChatGPT is and how it even popped up, talk a bit about the organization behind GPT called \"OpenAI\", which has already created many other machine learning models besides Chat GPT and also explain technically about all that.\nAnd then we'll dive in and actually put ChatGPT to use for some DevOps related tasks.\nI really want to see how it can help in generating configuration code for building DevOps processes or different parts of those processes and how well it knows different DevOps technologies, but not just some shallow examples or boilerplate code that I can get from official documentation, but instead also try more fine-tuning and small optimizations in that configuration code.\n\nWe're also going to check out an open source command line tool that is built on top of ChatGPT and was specifically created for engineers to generate infrastructure as code templates and more and finally we'll talk about the impact of ChatGPT, the quality and usefulness of such a tool for engineers and whether it will really replace the engineers and to what extent you should be concerned.\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac T I M E S T A M P S \u23f0  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n00:00 - Intro and Overview\n01:39 - What is ChatGPT, Who developed ChatGPT\n06:45 - Sign Up on ChatGPT\n09:23 - Create Dockerfile for Node.js app using ChatGPT\n22:13 - Create Kubernetes manifest file using ChatGPT\n35:06 - Create CI\/CD pipeline code using ChatGPT\n50:06 - Convert Jenkinsfile into GitLab CI config file\n53:53 - Tools built on top of OpenAI's API\n55:01 - AIaC demo - CLI tool for DevOps\n01:01:00 - My opinion on ChatGPT & whether ChatGPT will replace engineers\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Want to learn more? \ud83d\ude80  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nFull Python course                                            \u25ba  https:\/\/youtu.be\/t8pPdKYpowI\nFull Docker course                                            \u25ba  https:\/\/youtu.be\/3c-iBn73dDE\nFull K8s course                                                  \u25ba  https:\/\/youtu.be\/X48VuDVv0do\nDevOps Tools explained                                   \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/2W9UEq6\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Connect with me \ud83d\udc4b   \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nINSTAGRAM             \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/2F3LXYJ\nTWITTER                   \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/3i54PUB\nLINKEDIN                  \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/3hWOLVT\nFB group                   \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/32UVSZP\nDEV                            \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/3h2fqiO\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Courses & Ebooks & Bootcamp \ud83d\ude80      \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \n\u25ba Become a DevOps Engineer - full educational program             \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc   https:\/\/bit.ly\/45mXaer\n\u25ba High-Quality and Hands-On Courses                                             \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc   https:\/\/bit.ly\/3BNS8Kv\n\u25ba Kubernetes 101 - compact and easy-to-read ebook bundle      \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc   https:\/\/bit.ly\/3Ozl28x",

But there is a lot of mix up of these two roles and many people and many companies often use them interchangeably. They mix the tasks and responsibilities of these two very often. For example there are plenty of job descriptions for \"DevOps Cloud Engineer\" or \"Cloud DevOps Engineer\", which would naturally make you think that they are the same role, but then why would you have two names for the same role?

There is a lot of discussion going on, where some people are asking whether platform engineering replaces DevOps. Many people say it goes hand in hand and is rather an addition to DevOps, but in reality it's a bit more complicated than that. Platform engineering actually changes a lot of established rules we knew about DevOps, SRE and Cloud engineering, it changes the game and introduces some new rules.\n\nSo let's clearly define, what platform engineering exactly is, more interestingly, why was there even a need for this new role and how it evolved and of course how it compares to DevOps and Cloud engineering and does it really replace any of these roles?\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac T I M E S T A M P S \u23f0  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n0:00 - Intro and Overview\n0:50 - Why Platform Engineering?

        "videoDescription":"Start your DevOps Career (Beginners - Advanced) - https:\/\/bit.ly\/DevOpsLearningPath-YT\n\nDevOps is a buzzword. It\u2019s huge right now in the tech community, and it\u2019s definitely becoming more central to how teams build software.\nIf you\u2019re starting with DevOps, this video will help you understand the basics and give you a good head-start on your journey. You will also learn about the different stages in DevOps, what tools are needed at each stage, and how potential problems should be handled.\n\nStart your DevOps Career (Beginners - Advanced) - https:\/\/bit.ly\/DevOpsLearningPath-YT\n\nIn this video we will cover the following topics:\n\n00:00 -  Introduction\n00:27 - Problems before DevOps\n01:33 - Two Stages of DevOps\n02:12 - Real World Scenario 1\n03:28 - Real World Scenario 2\n04:12 - Automation\n05:06 - Benefits of DevOps\n06:10 - Summary\n07:22 - Conclusion\n \nThose new to the Programming and DevOps world often find it challenging to start their journey due to the missing basic prerequisites. For example, issues with setting up a basic lab environment using VirtualBox, problems with networking, or trouble with working with the Linux CLI or text editors like vi editor. Sometimes there are issues with applications - like getting a sample application to work, problems with getting the dependencies to install correctly or trouble with getting a web server to communicate with a database server. Or, at other times, it's working with data formats like JSON or YAML.\n\nSo we have identified a gap, and we believe that this is due to missing some of the basic prerequisites, such as knowing the basics of Linux, the basics of tools like VirtualBox, or knowing the basics of the most commonly used applications like Java, Python or NodeJS or web servers like Apache, NGINX etc. As a DevOps or Cloud Engineer, it is crucial to have these basics cleared. And that\u2019s why we are helping you to bridge that gap!\n\nWant to view a clear path to becoming a DevOps Engineer? Visit our website kodekloud.com!\nWe have various Learning Paths to help you choose your next step and shape your DevOps Career. \n\nCheck out our learning paths at KodeKloud to get started:\n\n -Linux: https:\/\/bit.ly\/LinuxLearningPath\n- DevOps Learning Path: https:\/\/bit.ly\/DevOpsLearningPath-YT\n -Docker: https:\/\/bit.ly\/DockerLearningPath\n -Kubernetes: https:\/\/bit.ly\/KubernetesLearningPath\n -Infrastructure as Code(IAC): https:\/\/bit.ly\/IACLearningPath\n -Programming: https:\/\/bit.ly\/ProgrammingLearningPath\n\nFor more updates on courses and tips, follow us on:\n-Website: https:\/\/kodekloud.com\/\n-LinkedIn: https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/kode...\n-Twitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/kodekloud1\n-Facebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/kodekloudtra...\n-Instagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/kodekloud\/\n-Blog: https:\/\/kodekloud.com\/blog\/\n\n#devops  #devopsengineer  #kodekloud",

You\u2019ll get a clear, practical explanation of DevOps, MLOps, AIOps, and DataOps, how AI agents fit across all of these domains, and how to think about your career without chasing hype or fear-driven narratives.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll learn in this video:\n\nWhy DevOps is not dying, but evolving into specialized domains\n\nThe real difference between DevOps, MLOps, AIOps, and DataOps\n\nWhere AI agents and agentic workflows actually fit in operations\n\nWhen it makes sense to stay in DevOps\n\nWhen transitioning to MLOps, AIOps, or DataOps is the right move\n\nWhy these paths are not mutually exclusive\n\nHow to choose a direction based on the problems that genuinely excite you\n\nThis video is designed for engineers who want clarity, not clickbait \u2014 and who want to make career decisions grounded in real systems, real demand, and real interest.\n\nIf this helped you understand where the industry is heading, consider subscribing. In upcoming videos, I\u2019ll go deeper into each specialization \u2014 DevOps, MLOps, AIOps, and DataOps \u2014 with real-world context and practical insights.\n\n#DevOps #MLOps #AIOps #DataOps #DevOpsCareer #AIAgents #AgenticWorkflows #CloudEngineering #FutureOfDevOps",

The main focus will be on the new Azure Managed DevOps Agent Pools, what they are, how they work, and why you might want to use them.\n\nWe\u2019ll start by deploying some prerequisites using Terraform, including a virtual network to host our agents. You\u2019ll see how to use the AzAPI provider to get the job done and I\u2019ll walk you through it all, step by step, as we build this Terraform project from scratch.\n\nOnce everything is up and running, we\u2019ll connect our agent to an Azure Pipeline and run a deployment to test it out.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to automate Azure DevOps agent pool provisioning with Terraform and AzAPI, or just want to learn more about CI\/CD in Azure, you\u2019re in the right place. Hope you enjoy the video!\n\nTimestamps: \n0:00 Intro\n1:00 Differences between managed devops pools and other offerings\n3:40 Comparison table between VMSS and Managed Devops Pool\n5:40 Writing our Terraform code\n27:50 Writing Terraform for our Managed Devops pool\n33:30 Deploying our code\n34:10 Create pipelines and test our pool\n38:20 Recap and outro\n\nLinks to learn documentation: \nhttps:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/devops\/pipelines\/agents\/agents?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml%2Cbrowser\nhttps:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/devops\/managed-devops-pools\/migrate-from-scale-set-agents?view=azure-devops\n\n\u2615\ufe0f Want to buy me a coffee? https:\/\/ko-fi.com\/lindbergtech\nOnly if you want to, of course\n\n\nSocials:\nLinkedIn:  https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/carl-lindberg-a7b76a175\/\nGithub: https:\/\/github.com\/carlzxc71\n\n#terraform #azure #microsoft #cloud #iac",

It's distributed so people around the world can share code\n2. It does version control\n\nSo, with version control, you can take snapshots of the state of your current code and maintain a history.\n\nBranching is really the third thing. Git branches allow developers to do isolated development and take chances without messing up the main branch.\n\nSo when someone asks me 'What is Git?', that is how I typically respond.",

Their job includes coming up with innovative recipes, testing them, and adding the successful ones to the menu. At the same time, they also prepare food to meet the regular demand of customers who visit the restaurant daily. This dual responsibility of innovation and ongoing service can become overwhelming, especially during busy hours when the kitchen is already at full capacity.\n\nWait staff, on the other hand, focus on delivering the prepared food to customers. Their primary role is to ensure that the food reaches the diners promptly and in perfect condition, keeping the restaurant\u2019s operations running smoothly.\n\nExperimenting with a new dish during peak hours, however, becomes a significant challenge. The process of testing new recipes while maintaining the flow of regular orders often leads to disruptions in the kitchen, causing delays and dissatisfaction among customers.\n\nTo address this, the restaurant hires a kitchen manager. The kitchen manager creates a separate small kitchen dedicated to experimenting with new dishes. This ensures that the chefs can focus on their innovations without interfering with the ongoing operations. Once a dish is perfected, the kitchen manager introduces automation, such as using a conveyor belt, to streamline the cooking process. This allows the new dish to be produced efficiently alongside the existing menu items while ensuring there are no interruptions in serving food to the restaurant's customers.\n\nYes, DevOps engineers are none other than automation experts.\n\n#devops #devopsengineer #careerguidance  #newvlog  #trendingreels \n\nroles and responsibilities devops engineer\ndoes devops engineer need coding\nwhat is devops for beginners\nroles of a devops engineer\njob description of devops engineer\nrequirements for devops engineer\nskills required for devops engineer\ndefinition of devops engineer\n@Ajayhr_01",

Platform Engineering focusses on the building the infrastructure and the systems that are needed for running your applications and supporting your application throughout the software life cycle. So,  the goal  is to support the developers in the organisation and treat them as customers. That\u2019s why we have in platform engineering the concept of IDP Internal developer platform.\n \nSo, this platform is treated as an actual product and the customers of the product are the developers.\nWhat is the role of the IDP?\nIt is to create a thin layer on top of the toolchain that is used inside the organisation to standardise the processes and help developers to have one way to deploy into production\n\nWHO AM I:\nHey friends, welcome to my YouTube channel  @outofdevops  .

What Is RabbitMQ?\n\nRabbitMQ is an open-source message broker \u2014 it acts as a middleman between different parts of a system that need to communicate asynchronously.\nIt uses the AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) as its core protocol.\n\nIn simpler terms:\n\nIt receives messages from producers (applications sending data),\n\nStores them temporarily in queues,\n\nAnd delivers them to consumers (applications receiving data).\n\nThis helps decouple systems \u2014 the sender and receiver don\u2019t need to be active at the same time.\n\n\u2699\ufe0f 2. Why Use RabbitMQ?\n\n\u2705 Decoupling \u2013 Producers don\u2019t need to know who consumes messages.\n\u2705 Asynchronous communication \u2013 Improves system responsiveness.\n\u2705 Load balancing \u2013 Messages can be distributed across multiple consumers.\n\u2705 Reliability \u2013 Ensures message delivery even if parts of the system fail.\n\u2705 Scalability \u2013 You can add more queues or consumers easily.\n\u2705 Flexible routing \u2013 Decide how messages flow using exchanges and routing keys.\n\n\ud83d\udd29 3. Core RabbitMQ Concepts\n\ud83c\udfed Producers\n\nApplications that send messages to RabbitMQ.\nThey don\u2019t send messages directly to a queue but to an exchange.\n\n\ud83c\udfaf Exchanges\n\nAn exchange routes messages to queues based on routing rules.\n\nExchange types:\n\nType Behavior Example Use Case\nDirect Routes messages to queues whose binding key exactly matches routing key Task queues\nFanout Broadcasts all messages to all queues bound to it Notifications, pub\/sub\nTopic Routes messages based on pattern matching (* and #) Selective subscriptions\nHeaders Routes based on header attributes Advanced filtering\n\nFollow my mentors too :\n\n@PavanElthepu    @MPrashant   @GouravSharma   @cloudwithraj   @AntonPutra   @AbhishekVeeramalla   @kubesimplify   @kshindi   @DevOpsJourney \n\n\n#docker  \n#k8s \n#kubernetes \n#cncf \n#kubernetestutorialforbeginners \n#keycloak\n#postgresql\n#kubernetesfullcourse \n#opensource \n#devops\n#argocd\n#awseks\n#ingress\n#secretmanager\n#secrets\n#oidc\n#ingress\n#gatewayapi\n#rabbitmq\n#kafka\n\nTags : #prometheus  #secrets #docker  #k8s #kubernetes #cncf #rbac #serverless #grafana #autoscaling #deployment  #opensource #devops #grafana #vault #terraform #kustomize #etcd #controlplane #container #ingress  #secretmanager #eks #keycloak #postgres #argocd #secrets #csidriver #secretstore #kafka #rabbitmq",

It's your dedication to perfecting your craft that creates true mastery. The greatest experts, like Jiro who's been making sushi daily for 80 years straight, understand something most technologists never grasp.\n\nThis is an excerpt from the \ud83c\udf71 DevOps Sushi - Part 1 \ud83c\udfac movie that is now available on https:\/\/makeitwork.tv.

        "videoDescription":"Linux Package Management for DevOps: Stop Breaking Your Deployments\n\nPackage managers are not exciting. But if you\u2019re a DevOps or Kubernetes engineer, they are absolutely foundational.\n\nIn this video, you\u2019ll learn Linux package management the way it really matters in production as an ongoing operational responsibility, not a one-time setup task. We\u2019ll connect tools like yum, apt and dnf directly to Ansible, CI\/CD pipelines and Kubernetes nodes so you actually understand what you\u2019re automating.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll learn:\n00:00 - Why DevOps engineers must understand package managers\n01:01 - Package Management in Real Cloud & Enterprise Environments\n01:19 - How DevOps Engineers Actually Use Package Managers (Reality Check)\n01:29 - What You\u2019ll Learn in This Video (Scope & Expectations)\n01:59 - What Is a Package Manager? (Concept, Not Commands)\n02:47 - Where Yum Gets Packages From & What It Really Does\n03:15 - RHEL Subscription Manager Explained (Enterprise Reality)\n05:33 - When You Don\u2019t Use Subscription Manager (Air-gapped & Internal Repos)\n05:52 - Yum Repository Configuration Explained (\/etc\/yum.repos.d)\n07:32 - Core Yum Commands DevOps Engineers Use Daily\n11:15 - Production Updates: What NOT to Do & How Updates Really Work\n12:14 - Why Blind yum update -y Breaks Production\n12:52 - Package Managers Across Distros (Yum vs Apt vs Zypper)\n13:37 - Final Takeaway: Why This Layer Matters for Kubernetes & Automation\n\nBy the end, you\u2019ll be able to:\n- Understand what yum\/apt\/dnf are doing under your automation tools\n- Avoid \u201cworks on my machine\u201d package issues in CI\/CD\n- Debug broken Kubernetes nodes at the Linux layer\n- Treat package management as a continuous DevOps responsibility\n\nThis video is part of my \u201cLinux for DevOps: From Zero to Hired\u201d series, designed for:\n- DevOps engineers\n- SREs and Platform engineers\n- Developers moving into Kubernetes and cloud-native roles\n\nNext step after package management: learn Linux networking basics, so Kubernetes networking finally makes sense.\n\nIf this helped, subscribe for more Linux for DevOps content and Kubernetes-focused breakdowns.\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Watch Related Playlists:\n- Kubernetes: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PL-K2rw28HIwZVMo9CtbV0wDu548SN0h9Y\n- Github Actions: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PL-K2rw28HIwYfq7SqYnBzAxlUhcYP7ldM\n- Ansible: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PL-K2rw28HIwaavCXTYEWF4mP431KmKtEY\n- AWX: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PL-K2rw28HIwbTtijpBMrOaHdnWGXdOkYa\n- AI: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PL-K2rw28HIwaSvmI8oFeSQDl4cVTdxaGQ\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Connect with me \ud83d\udc4b \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\nLinkedIn: https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/kumar-nikhil811\/\nWebsite: https:\/\/techinik.com\nMedium: https:\/\/medium.com\/@kumarnikhil811\n\n#linux  #devops  #linuxfordevops #kubernetes  #ansible  #yum  #apt  #dnf  #cloud  #sre",

It's the soundtrack for late-night coding sessions, for learning, and for the union between logic and emotion.\n\nLeave a comment and tell us which part of the lyrics resonated most with you! Do you feel this DNA-DevOps in your daily routine?\n\n(Evig Eies, forever owned, forever known...)\n\nVerse 1:\n(Piano and Cello begin, sparse and reflective)\nLines of code, a digital thread,\nWeaving futures, words unsaid.\nFrom concept's spark to a living stream,\nA silent promise, a waking dream.\nChorus:\n(Bass and drums enter, subtle and driving, clean electric guitar adds texture)\nOh, DNA-DevOps, a rhythm deep inside,\nWhere logic flows and errors hide.\nEvig Eies, a truth we hold so dear,\nBuilding bridges, conquering fear.\nVerse 2:\n(Vocals become more prominent, velvety and slightly melancholic)\nThrough countless iterations, we refine,\nEach commit, a purpose, a design.\nFrom whispered thoughts to a grand display,\nGuiding progress, lighting the way.\nChorus:\n(Instrumentation builds slightly, still restrained)\nOh, DNA-DevOps, a rhythm deep inside,\nWhere logic flows and errors hide.\nEvig Eies, a truth we hold so dear,\nBuilding bridges, conquering fear.\nBridge:\n(Cello takes a more melodic lead, piano arpeggios, drums become more intricate)\nIn the quiet hum of the server's grace,\nA human touch in this digital space.\nWe learn, we grow, we adapt, we mend,\nA cycle endless, without an end.\nChorus:\n(Fuller sound, but still maintaining the minimalist feel)\nOh, DNA-DevOps, a rhythm deep inside,\nWhere logic flows and errors hide.\nEvig Eies, a truth we hold so dear,\nBuilding bridges, conquering fear.\nOutro:\n(Instrumentation slowly fades, piano and cello linger)\nEvig Eies, forever owned, forever known...\nA silent promise, deeply sown.\n(Silence)\n\n#DNADevOps #EvigEies #CodingMusic #SoftwareEngineering #DevOps #IndieMusic #AmbientPop #TechMusic #CreationCycle #originalmusic",

        "videoDescription":"Are you new to DevOps and wondering what Prometheus actually does? In this short video, we break it down in a simple, beginner-friendly way.\n\nPrometheus is a powerful open-source monitoring tool used by DevOps teams around the world. It pulls metrics from your servers, stores them as time-series data, and triggers alerts whenever thresholds are broken. This proactive approach helps teams detect issues before they impact users, improving uptime and system reliability.\n\nUnlike log-based monitoring, Prometheus focuses on quantitative metrics like CPU usage, memory consumption, response times, and error rates. By monitoring these metrics continuously, DevOps engineers and SREs (Site Reliability Engineers) can maintain healthy systems, reduce downtime, and scale cloud-native infrastructure efficiently.\n\nThis video is perfect for beginners who want to understand Prometheus in under 20 seconds and start applying monitoring in real-world projects. Whether you\u2019re managing corporate training platforms, retail applications, or cloud infrastructure, this knowledge is essential.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Save this video and follow the channel for more quick DevOps tutorials, beginner tips, and monitoring hacks.

Hugo isn't a real engineer and therefore never learned how to write .yml in devops properly - but with AI it was very straightforward to:\n\n-- Build an action that parameterises key inputs like the branch name, environment, and other environment variables\n-- Trigger Orchestra Pipelines in staging environments with different configurations\n-- Implement polling logic to understand what pipelines are complete\n\nThe code for this example can be found at https:\/\/docs.getorchestra.io\/docs\/git-control-and-ci-cd\/ci-cd\/azure_devops\n\nReady to get started with Orchestra?

        "videoDescription":"Welcome to Day 1  of Anisble in the DevOps Full Course by DevOpsFarm! \ud83d\ude80\n\nThis video transcript details a deep-dive tutorial on Ansible, the industry-leading Configuration as Code (CAC) tool.\n\nHere is a complete YouTube package, including the video description, chapters, and tags.\n\nYouTube Video Description\nThis is your complete, hands-on tutorial for Ansible, the powerful, agentless tool for Configuration as Code (CAC). We will show you how Ansible solves the major DevOps problem of managing and configuring hundreds of servers efficiently and consistently.\n\nWe begin by establishing the crucial difference between Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform (which creates machines) and Configuration as Code tools like Ansible (which configures those machines).\n\nWhat you will learn in this video:\n\n\u27a4 Configuration Management Fundamentals: Understand why manual scripting on multiple machines is inefficient and how Ansible automates security hardening, software installation (like PostgreSQL, Grafana), and application deployment.\n\n\u27a4 Ansible Architecture: Learn about the Controller Node and why Ansible is agentless, using standard SSH\/SCP protocols to manage hosts, unlike other tools that require an agent installation.\n\n\u27a4 Core Concepts Explained: Deep dive into the four essential elements of Ansible:\n\n\u27a4 Modules: The basic units of work (Python scripts) that perform specific tasks (e.g., ping, shell, mysql).\n\n\u27a4 Playbooks: YAML files that define a set of tasks to run on specific hosts.\n\n\u27a4 Inventory: The list of hosts (IPs, usernames) that Ansible manages.\n\n\u27a4 Idempotence: A key concept ensuring that running the same command multiple times yields the same, predictable outcome, preventing configuration drift.\n\n\u27a4 Terraform vs. Ansible: A clear comparison, including why Terraform is better suited for Cloud (like AWS) and configuration management tools are essential for On-Premise (data center) environments.\n\nChapters :-\nTimestamp Chapter Title\n00:00:28 Introducing Ansible: Configuration as Code (CAC)\n00:01:07 Review of the DevOps SDLC Pipeline (Plan, Code, Test, Deploy)\n00:03:28 Differentiating Terraform (IaC) vs. Configuration Management\n00:03:54 Terraform Limitations: Cloud vs. On-Premise Use Cases\n00:07:28 Defining On-Premise Infrastructure and Hypervisors\n00:08:50 The Need for Automation (The Configuration Problem)\n00:09:14 Configuration Tasks: Security Hardening, Software Installation, Monitoring Setup\n00:10:53 Why Configuration as Code (CAC) is a Must for Uniformity\n00:13:41 The Challenge: Manually Managing Configuration on 100+ Servers\n00:18:46 Introducing Ansible to Solve the Automation Challenge\n00:27:15 What is Ansible? (A Collection of Python Scripts)\n00:29:59 Key Feature: Idempotence Explained\n00:32:04 Ansible Architecture: Controller Node and Agentless Design\n00:33:37 Ansible Core Components: Modules (Shell, Database, etc.)\n00:35:48 Ansible Core Components: Playbooks (YAML), Inventory, and Roles\n00:44:22 The Advantage of Agentless Architecture (Using SSH)\n00:53:39 Introduction to Ansible Ad-Hoc Commands\n00:57:57 Testing Ad-Hoc Command Connectivity (Ping Module Demo)\n\n#Ansible\n#ConfigurationAsCode\n#CAC\n#ConfigurationManagement\n#DevOps\n#AnsibleTutorial\n#AnsibleAgentless\n#AnsibleModules\n#AnsiblePlaybooks\n#TerraformVsAnsible\n#InfrastructureAsCode\n#IAC\n#OnPremise\n#CloudComputing\n#Idempotence\n#Automation\n#DevOpsTools\n#Linux",

You will then be guided through provisioning the necessary AWS infrastructure using Terraform, establishing the Controller Node, and connecting it to the Managed Nodes.\n\nWhat you will learn in this session:\n\u27a4 Ansible Architecture: Reviewing the Controller Node and Managed Node design, and the vital role of Python on the Controller.\n\n\u27a4 Lab Setup: Provisioning three EC2 instances on AWS using Terraform to prepare for the demo.\n\n\u27a4 Running Commands: Understanding the two primary ways to run Ansible: Ad-Hoc Commands (for quick, one-shot testing and debugging) and Playbooks. \n\n\u27a4 Ansible Modules: Deep dive into how modules (like apt or yum) are used for specific tasks, and how to control them with parameters (e.g., present or absent).\n\n\u27a4 Mastering Inventory: A detailed breakdown of the hosts.ini file, including defining host addresses, setting connection variables (ansible_user, ansible_password), and logically organizing machines using Inventory Groups (e.g., front-end and back-end).\n\n\u27a4 Best Practices: How to use the [all:vars] section in your inventory to apply common configurations globally, adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.\n\n\u27a4 Advanced Topics: Introduction to Ansible Variables, Jinja2 Templating, and the concept of Ansible Roles for highly reusable, community-driven configurations (like installing PostgreSQL).\n\n00:00:16 \nRecap: Terraform (IaC) vs. Ansible (CAC) Differences \n\n\n00:01:11 \nReview of Ansible Components (Modules, Inventory, Playbooks, Roles) \n\n00:02:18 \nAnsible Architecture: Controller Node and Managed Nodes \n\n00:02:37 \nController Node Requirements: Python & Ansible Dependency \n\n00:04:16 \nLab Setup: Provisioning 3 AWS Machines using Terraform \n\n\n00:10:53 \nTwo Ways to Run Ansible: Ad-Hoc Commands vs. Playbooks \n\n00:11:38 \nAd-Hoc Commands: Use Cases (Quick Testing & Debugging) \n\n\n00:12:12 \nDeep Dive into Ansible Modules (e.g., Package Installation) \n\n\n\n00:13:22 \nAnsible Inventory Explained (The hosts.ini file) \n\n00:14:30 \nConfiguring Inventory: ansible_user and ansible_password \n\n00:15:39 \nOrganizing Hosts with Inventory Groups (Front-end\/Back-end) \n\n00:27:54 \nDRY Principle: Using [all:vars] for Global Configuration \n\n00:30:48 \nHands-on: Using the shell Module to Run OS Commands \n\n01:23:25 \nAnsible Variables and Special Variables \n\n01:26:19 \nIntroduction to Jinja2 Templating \n\n\n01:46:51 \nReusable Code and Ansible Roles (Postgres Example)\n\n#Ansible\n#ConfigurationAsCode\n#AnsibleTutorial\n#AnsibleInventory\n#AnsibleModules\n#AnsibleAdHoc\n#AnsibleRoles\n#TerraformVsAnsible\n#DevOps\n#IaC\n#CAC\n#AWS\n#EC2\n#LinuxAutomation\n#Jinja2\n#Automation\n#DevOpsTools",

        "videoDescription":"\u201cHi everyone, welcome back to AWS Certified! In this video, we\u2019re going to start our journey into the AWS Certified DevOps Engineer \u2013 Professional exam.\n\nThis certification is designed for people who already have some AWS experience and want to prove their skills in automation, CI\/CD, logging and security on AWS. It\u2019s one of the most respected certifications for cloud engineers and DevOps professionals.\n\nNow, although the exam is multiple-choice the exam itself is tough as it scenario-based, which means you\u2019ll need to think like a real-world AWS engineer, not just memorise facts. That\u2019s why in this series, I\u2019ll be breaking down real exam-style questions, and will show you helpful hints from the Exam guide and other exam materials and will show you not only the correct answers, but also the reasoning and solutions behind them.\n\nEach video will be short and focused, so you can learn quickly and build confidence step by step.\"\n\nSo, if you\u2019re ready, make sure you Like and Subscribe, and let\u2019s dive into the learning!\u201d\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\n\nThis is my LinkedIn Profile with the Certification Page: https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/shrenikjob\/details\/certifications\/\n\nThank you.",

        "videoDescription":"Prometheus is powerful\u2014but Prometheus alone isn\u2019t enough. In modern DevOps and cloud environments, collecting and storing metrics is only half the job. \n\nYou also need clear, real-time visualization to fully understand what\u2019s happening inside your complex systems. That\u2019s where the Prometheus + Grafana combo becomes absolutely essential for any team aiming for efficiency. \n\nPrometheus is responsible for collecting and storing crucial system metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, response time, and error rates. It works efficiently using time-series data and triggers alerts when specific thresholds are exceeded, ensuring that you can act quickly when issues arise. \n\nHowever, raw metrics alone can be challenging and difficult to interpret at scale, especially in large environments. This is where Grafana steps in to solve this problem by transforming Prometheus metrics into beautiful, interactive real-time dashboards that are easy to read and understand. \n\nWith Grafana, DevOps teams can visualize trends, detect anomalies faster, and monitor the overall health of their infrastructure at a glance, making it far easier to manage resources. \n\nThis powerful combination is widely used in cloud-native applications, Kubernetes orchestration, and enterprise-level DevOps environments across various industries. \n\nTogether, Prometheus and Grafana help teams move from reactive troubleshooting to proactive monitoring and observability, making it easier to identify potential issues before they escalate. \n\nThat\u2019s precisely why this stack is a standard choice for a wide range of professionals, including DevOps engineers, Site Reliability Engineers (SREs), and cloud architects who are on the front lines of technology. If you\u2019re learning DevOps or currently working with monitoring tools, understanding how Prometheus and Grafana work together is an invaluable must-have skill that can greatly enhance your capabilities. \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Comment \u201cGrafana\u201d if you want a full video explaining dashboards, metrics, and real-world setups, including tips and best practices. \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Follow for more bite-sized DevOps and monitoring content that can help you stay up to date in this fast-evolving field. \n\nRef: https:\/\/prometheus.io\/\n\nEduarn is a modern Learning Management System (LMS) and professional training platform designed for skill development, corporate training, and career growth.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 Eduarn LMS: https:\/\/eduarn.com\/eduarn-lms\n\ud83d\udd39 Eduarn Training Programs: https:\/\/eduarn.com\/eduarn-training\n\ud83d\udd39 Eduarn Courses & Learning Solutions: https:\/\/eduarn.com\n\n\ud83d\udcd8 Follow Eduarn on LinkedIn\n\u2022 Eduarn \u2013 LMS & Training Newsletter:\nhttps:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/build-relation\/newsletter-follow?entityUrn=7367433347712643072\n\n\u2022 Tech Interview by Eduarn:\nhttps:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/build-relation\/newsletter-follow?entityUrn=7384113239699148801\n\n\ud83d\udcdd Eduarn Blogs & Resources:\nhttps:\/\/blogs.eduarn.com\n\n\ud83d\udcf1 Follow Eduarn on Social Media\nInstagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/eduarnofficial\nThreads: https:\/\/www.threads.com\/@eduarnofficial\nX (Twitter): https:\/\/x.com\/eduarnofficial",

        "videoDescription":"Monitoring is not optional anymore \u2014 it\u2019s a survival tool.\n\nIn modern DevOps and cloud environments, waiting for users to report problems means damage is already done. Downtime, poor performance, and system failures directly impact customer trust, revenue, and brand reputation. That\u2019s exactly why monitoring tools exist.\n\nTools like Prometheus are designed to monitor your systems 24\/7, collecting critical metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, request latency, and error rates. Instead of reacting to failures, monitoring allows teams to detect issues early, trigger alerts, and resolve problems before customers even notice.\n\nThis is the core difference between reactive IT teams and high-performing DevOps teams. Proactive monitoring helps organizations reduce downtime, improve system reliability, and maintain a seamless user experience\u2014especially in cloud-native and Kubernetes-based infrastructures.\n\nIn this short video, you\u2019ll understand why monitoring exists, what problem it solves, and why Prometheus has become one of the most widely used open-source monitoring tools in the DevOps ecosystem.\n\nIf you are a DevOps engineer, cloud engineer, SRE, backend developer, or IT professional, mastering monitoring tools like Prometheus is essential for your career growth.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Follow this channel for simple, clear DevOps concepts explained in short videos.\n\ud83d\udc49 More videos coming on Prometheus, Grafana, alerts, and real-world DevOps practices.\n\nEduarn is a modern Learning Management System (LMS) and professional training platform designed for skill development, corporate training, and career growth.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 Eduarn LMS: https:\/\/eduarn.com\/eduarn-lms\n\ud83d\udd39 Eduarn Training Programs: https:\/\/eduarn.com\/eduarn-training\n\ud83d\udd39 Eduarn Courses & Learning Solutions: https:\/\/eduarn.com\n\n\ud83d\udcd8 Follow Eduarn on LinkedIn\n\u2022 Eduarn \u2013 LMS & Training Newsletter:\nhttps:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/build-relation\/newsletter-follow?entityUrn=7367433347712643072\n\n\u2022 Tech Interview by Eduarn:\nhttps:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/build-relation\/newsletter-follow?entityUrn=7384113239699148801\n\n\ud83d\udcdd Eduarn Blogs & Resources:\nhttps:\/\/blogs.eduarn.com\n\n\ud83d\udcf1 Follow Eduarn on Social Media\nInstagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/eduarnofficial\nThreads: https:\/\/www.threads.com\/@eduarnofficial\nX (Twitter): https:\/\/x.com\/eduarnofficial",

        "videoDescription":"Monitoring tools don\u2019t have to be complicated.\n\nIn this short video, monitoring tools are explained in the simplest possible way, so even beginners can understand them easily. Think of monitoring tools as health trackers for servers and applications. Just like a smartwatch tracks your heartbeat, monitoring tools track the health of your systems.\n\nPrometheus plays a key role in modern DevOps monitoring. It continuously checks system metrics such as CPU usage, memory, response time, and error rates. This constant monitoring helps teams understand how healthy their infrastructure is at any moment.\n\nWhen something feels wrong\u2014like a sudden spike in CPU usage or a drop in performance\u2014alerts automatically fire. This allows DevOps teams to act quickly, often fixing issues before users even notice. That\u2019s why monitoring is essential for cloud platforms, corporate systems, retail applications, and large-scale infrastructure.\n\nThis video is perfect for DevOps beginners, IT students, cloud engineers, and anyone new to monitoring tools. Simple explanations build strong foundations, and understanding monitoring early will help you grow faster in your DevOps journey.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Subscribe for more easy DevOps explanations, monitoring basics, and real-world tech concepts explained in short videos.\nRef: https:\/\/prometheus.io\/\n\nEduarn is a modern Learning Management System (LMS) and professional training platform designed for skill development, corporate training, and career growth.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 Eduarn LMS: https:\/\/eduarn.com\/eduarn-lms\n\ud83d\udd39 Eduarn Training Programs: https:\/\/eduarn.com\/eduarn-training\n\ud83d\udd39 Eduarn Courses & Learning Solutions: https:\/\/eduarn.com\n\n\ud83d\udcd8 Follow Eduarn on LinkedIn\n\u2022 Eduarn \u2013 LMS & Training Newsletter:\nhttps:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/build-relation\/newsletter-follow?entityUrn=7367433347712643072\n\n\u2022 Tech Interview by Eduarn:\nhttps:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/build-relation\/newsletter-follow?entityUrn=7384113239699148801\n\n\ud83d\udcdd Eduarn Blogs & Resources:\nhttps:\/\/blogs.eduarn.com\n\n\ud83d\udcf1 Follow Eduarn on Social Media\nInstagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/eduarnofficial\nThreads: https:\/\/www.threads.com\/@eduarnofficial\nX (Twitter): https:\/\/x.com\/eduarnofficial",

The result is a workflow that\u2019s easier to understand, debug, secure, and scale.\n\nIt\u2019s not just naming \u2014 it\u2019s architecture through semantics.\n\n**Key idea:** Architecture is language.

He highlights the creative, open culture that supports innovation across complex pharmaceutical operations.\n\nAt AUTOMA+ 2025, Joachim shared practical insights into digital implementation in regulated environments, stressing that successful transformation depends on choosing the right timing, decision-makers and use cases. He underlined that digital progress is rarely linear and often challenging, but ultimately rewarding when organisations are willing to navigate complexity. A key takeaway was the importance of breaking silos between people rather than focusing solely on data, ensuring shared understanding across scientific, regulatory and digital teams.\n\nJoachim also reflected on the value of AI in harmonising documentation across systems, improving alignment for regulatory submissions. He praised AUTOMA+ for exposing him to new perspectives beyond his usual focus, particularly regulatory discussions, and for the strong networking format supported by BGS Group, which made meaningful connections easy and impactful.\n\n\ud83d\udccd Filmed at AUTOMA+ 2025 \u2013 Pharma Automation & Digitalisation Congress\n\ud83c\udfa5 Organised by BGS Group \u2013 https:\/\/bgs.group\/events\/\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Learn more about AUTOMA+: https:\/\/automa.plus\/\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Follow BGS Group for more insights from pharma and digital leaders \u2013 https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@BGSGroup\n\n#AUTOMAplus2024 #BoehringerIngelheim #PharmaDigitalisation #DevOps #CellCulture #AIinPharma #ChangeManagement #Regulatory #LifeSciences #BGSGroup\n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:21 Company overview and pharma portfolio\n01:17 Digital implementation challenges and decision-making\n02:24 Regulatory insights and new perspectives\n03:26 Breaking silos between people, not just data\n04:14 AI for document alignment and regulatory confidence\n05:23 Networking experience and value of AUTOMA+",
