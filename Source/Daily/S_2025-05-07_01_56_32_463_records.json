It has become a buzzword within days of its release and professionals in all fields, especially in high skilled areas like lawyers, doctors, engineers are questioning whether such AI can actually replace them and work.\n\nSo in this video I want to talk about what ChatGPT is and how it even popped up, talk a bit about the organization behind GPT called \"OpenAI\", which has already created many other machine learning models besides Chat GPT and also explain technically about all that.\nAnd then we'll dive in and actually put ChatGPT to use for some DevOps related tasks.\nI really want to see how it can help in generating configuration code for building DevOps processes or different parts of those processes and how well it knows different DevOps technologies, but not just some shallow examples or boilerplate code that I can get from official documentation, but instead also try more fine-tuning and small optimizations in that configuration code.\n\nWe're also going to check out an open source command line tool that is built on top of ChatGPT and was specifically created for engineers to generate infrastructure as code templates and more and finally we'll talk about the impact of ChatGPT, the quality and usefulness of such a tool for engineers and whether it will really replace the engineers and to what extent you should be concerned.\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac T I M E S T A M P S \u23f0  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n00:00 - Intro and Overview\n01:39 - What is ChatGPT, Who developed ChatGPT\n06:45 - Sign Up on ChatGPT\n09:23 - Create Dockerfile for Node.js app using ChatGPT\n22:13 - Create Kubernetes manifest file using ChatGPT\n35:06 - Create CI\/CD pipeline code using ChatGPT\n50:06 - Convert Jenkinsfile into GitLab CI config file\n53:53 - Tools built on top of OpenAI's API\n55:01 - AIaC demo - CLI tool for DevOps\n01:01:00 - My opinion on ChatGPT & whether ChatGPT will replace engineers\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Want to learn more? \ud83d\ude80  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nFull Python course                                            \u25ba  https:\/\/youtu.be\/t8pPdKYpowI\nFull Docker course                                            \u25ba  https:\/\/youtu.be\/3c-iBn73dDE\nFull K8s course                                                  \u25ba  https:\/\/youtu.be\/X48VuDVv0do\nDevOps Tools explained                                   \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/2W9UEq6\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Connect with me \ud83d\udc4b   \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nINSTAGRAM             \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/2F3LXYJ\nTWITTER                   \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/3i54PUB\nLINKEDIN                  \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/3hWOLVT\nFB group                   \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/32UVSZP\nDEV                            \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/3h2fqiO\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Courses & Ebooks & Bootcamp \ud83d\ude80      \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \n\u25ba Become a DevOps Engineer - full educational program             \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc   https:\/\/bit.ly\/45mXaer\n\u25ba High-Quality and Hands-On Courses                                             \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc   https:\/\/bit.ly\/3BNS8Kv\n\u25ba Kubernetes 101 - compact and easy-to-read ebook bundle      \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc   https:\/\/bit.ly\/3Ozl28x",

        "videoDescription":"Differences and Overlaps of Cloud and DevOps Engineer Roles as well as deep dive of Cloud Engineer Tasks and Responsibilities\n\nDevOps engineer and Cloud engineer are 2 popular roles in software engineering. But there is a lot of mix up of these two roles and many people and many companies often use them interchangeably. They mix the tasks and responsibilities of these two very often. For example there are plenty of job descriptions for \"DevOps Cloud Engineer\" or \"Cloud DevOps Engineer\", which would naturally make you think that they are the same role, but then why would you have two names for the same role?

There is a lot of discussion going on, where some people are asking whether platform engineering replaces DevOps. Many people say it goes hand in hand and is rather an addition to DevOps, but in reality it's a bit more complicated than that. Platform engineering actually changes a lot of established rules we knew about DevOps, SRE and Cloud engineering, it changes the game and introduces some new rules.\n\nSo let's clearly define, what platform engineering exactly is, more interestingly, why was there even a need for this new role and how it evolved and of course how it compares to DevOps and Cloud engineering and does it really replace any of these roles?\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac T I M E S T A M P S \u23f0  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n0:00 - Intro and Overview\n0:50 - Why Platform Engineering?

Or, at other times, it's working with data formats like JSON or YAML.\n\nSo we have identified a gap, and we believe that this is due to missing some of the basic prerequisites, such as knowing the basics of Linux, the basics of tools like VirtualBox, or knowing the basics of the most commonly used applications like Java, Python or NodeJS or web servers like Apache, NGINX etc. As a DevOps or Cloud Engineer, it is crucial to have these basics cleared.

A decade of engineering helps in systems thinking and product building. Learning about Strategy, Marketing, People Management, and Finance on the go. \n\nWhat am I building? Today, 25 million Indians prepare for government job entrance exams. They do it for years together. The probability of success is less than 1% but they still do it. Why? For the lack of a structured alternative to launch their white-collar career. I am building Invact to bridge this gap. \nHow? Follow me to know, it's a long story.

In the present-day scenario of IT organizations, DevOps Engineer is one of the most demanding job profiles with no signs of slowing down. No wonder DevOps will rule the IT world in the upcoming times! If you\u2019re looking forward to making a career as a DevOps Engineer, this video is for you.\n\n***FREE WEEK SEP 19-25***\nACCESS TO ALL FREE PREMIUM COURSE: https:\/\/kode.wiki\/FREECOURSE_YT\n\nVisit our learning path at https:\/\/bit.ly\/DevOpsLearningPath-YT\n\nThis video consists of the following:\n00:00 - Introduction\n00:35 - What is DevOps?\n01:38 - What does a DevOps Engineer do?\n03:26 - Why is there a great demand for DevOps?\n03:56 - What do you need to know?\n04:25 - Linux operating system, scripting and networking\n04:58 - Git Version Control\n05:23 - A Programming Language (Python or Go)\n05:59 - CI\/CD Deployment tools\n06:21 - Containers and Orchestration\n06:48 - How do you get started?\n08:37 - Conclusion\n\nThose new to the Cloud and DevOps world often find it challenging to start their journey due to the missing basic prerequisites. For example, issues with setting up a basic lab environment using VirtualBox, problems with networking, or trouble with working with the Linux CLI or text editors like vi editor. Sometimes there are issues with applications - like getting a sample application to work, problems with getting the dependencies to install correctly or trouble with getting a web server to communicate with a database server. Or, at other times, it's working with data formats like JSON or YAML.\n\nSo we have identified a gap, and we believe that this is due to missing some of the basic prerequisites, such as knowing the basics of Linux, the basics of tools like VirtualBox, or knowing the basics of the most commonly used applications like Java, Python or NodeJS or web servers like Apache, NGINX etc. As a DevOps or Cloud Engineer, it is crucial to have these basics cleared. And that\u2019s why we are helping you to bridge that gap!\n\nWant to view a clear path to becoming a DevOps Engineer?

        "videoDescription":"This video captures my presentation delivered at the DevOps Meetup in Z\u00fcrich on January 25, 2024, where I delve into the prevalent challenges faced by traditional DevOps methodologies, characterized by isolated teams and fragmented value streams that impede efficiency. It explores DevOps as a holistic culture, mindset, and suite of technical practices designed to foster continuous value delivery, prioritize products over projects, and focus on customer-centric development. Additionally, I introduce Platform Engineering as a strategic evolution of DevOps aimed at mitigating the technical and operational complexities encountered when scaling DevOps in larger enterprises. Highlighting a collaborative project with LGT and Z\u00fchlke, I present the Platform Plane case study, demonstrating how an internal developer platform can streamline and standardize DevOps processes across various teams, thereby reducing cognitive load and enhancing productivity. This presentation goes beyond theoretical discussion, offering a hands-on demonstration of the Platform Plane and its functionalities, including Kubernetes as a service, API gateway, and Service Mesh, among others. It illustrates the vital role of Platform Engineering in enabling product teams to adopt DevOps more efficiently and effectively, leading to an optimized development lifecycle.\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac T I M E S T A M P S \u23f0  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n00:00 Intro\n00:08 Welcome\n00:31 About me\n02:36 Today's challenges\n04:33 DevOps is here to help\n05:20 Who is DevOps?\n06:44 The Benefit of DevOps\n08:05 DevOps is bullshit?\n08:27 What are the Challenges with DevOps?\n08:59 You build it you run it\n10:18 Think about that on scale.\n11:06 Can you scale DevOps?\n11:23 Example of What companies want\n15:50 The Digital Factory \n16:35 Platform Engineering Enables DevOps in Product Teams.\n18:30 The Gartner Top Strategic Technology Trends for 2024. \n19:29 Platform Engineering Improves DevOps Efficiency.\n20:24 The Platform Plane: Big Picture.\n22:04 The Platform Plane: High Level Architecture\n21:56 Demo 1 - The Admin Areas\n25:56 Demo 2 - Platform Plane\n26:01 Platform Plane- Main page\n26:27 Documentations\n27:38 AI Assistant\n29:21 Platform plane:\n30:12 - GitLab\n30:44 - Repositories \n32:13 - Registry\n33:40 - Package Management\n36:42 - Hypervisor ( virtual machines)\n36:52 - Identity \n37:56- Chat\n39:07 Summary\n39:45 Outro\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac  L I N K S  \ud83d\udd17\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nPlatform Plane: \n\u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/rSUI6-R4DlM\n\nLGT: \n\u27a4 https:\/\/www.lgt.com\/\n\nZ\u00fchlke: \n\u27a4 https:\/\/www.zuehlke.com\/\n\nDevOps Meetup Z\u00fcrich: \n\u27a4 https:\/\/www.meetup.com\/devops-meetup-zurich\/\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Want to learn more? \ud83d\ude80  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \n\nYou're developing products, not projects \n\u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/ImbhUFr6suw?si=UeSOAR67hZcJWE5T\n\nDevOps \n\u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/Ath3XoLbYxY?si=xzJzs4Fqpst6uxqm\n\nApply continous testing and build-in quality \n\u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/W0QZRpf7ElM?si=oe54rFG0uEXtHUbJ\n\nApply continous security \n\u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/340YmM08Eb0?si=QFOGkCnUElDXevR-\n\nBuild a platform\n \u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/UE8mSt55xHw?si=cc6_S_6Wv6iwA_y1\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac  S U B S C R I B E  \ud83d\udd14 \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \n\u2554\u2550\u2566\u2557\u2554\u2566\u2557\u2554\u2550\u2566\u2550\u2566\u2566\u2566\u2566\u2557\u2554\u2550\u2557\n\u2551\u255a\u2563\u2551\u2551\u2551\u255a\u2563\u255a\u2563\u2554\u2563\u2554\u2563\u2551\u255a\u2563\u2550\u2563\n\u2560\u2557\u2551\u255a\u255d\u2551\u2551\u2560\u2557\u2551\u255a\u2563\u2551\u2551\u2551\u2551\u2551\u2550\u2563\n\u255a\u2550\u2569\u2550\u2550\u2569\u2550\u2569\u2550\u2569\u2550\u2569\u255d\u255a\u2569\u2550\u2569\u2550\u255d\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCXvlc9x4zlv5DEqbby55Ivg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Connect with me \ud83d\udc4b  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nLINKEDIN                  \u25ba https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/romanoroth\/\nTWITTER                   \u25ba https:\/\/twitter.com\/RomanoRoth\nINSTAGRAM             \u25ba https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/romanoroth\/\nFACEBOOK               \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/romanoroth\/\nMEETUP                   \u25ba https:\/\/www.meetup.com\/de-DE\/DevOps-Meetup-Zurich\/\nCONFERNCE            \u25bahttps:\/\/www.devopsdays.ch\/\nHOMEPAGE              \u25ba  https:\/\/www.romanoroth.com\/\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac  P L A Y L I S T S  \u25b6\ufe0f \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nModern Software Engineering\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLrsbMazVPK_rb56rZQr2fyBGR3cyanZpX\nDevOps\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLrsbMazVPK_ro3fn1G-3Ui2mBPHxOD9kF\nGitLab: Build a DevSecOps Pipeline\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLrsbMazVPK_qhf3ahA_zRPlwBaGGhSu2P\n\n#devsecops  #devops #romanoroth #platformengineering",

No \ud83d\ude09.\nDon't panic and check out the talk \ud83c\udf9e I had with Pia Wiedermayer on this topic.\n\nIs DevOps really the reason why testing and quality assurance (QA) employees are being increasingly automated out of a job?\nPia Wiedermayer, Head of QA, and Romano Roth, Head of DevOps, discuss different ways to incorporate the wealth of experience of testing and QA specialists into the agile team culture.\n\nInsight: \n- DevOps is often equated with automation\n- What does this mean for people in these roles and with these responsibilities?\n- Testers offer a wealth of experience that can be incorporated into the\nagile team culture\n\nSoftware testing and quality assurance are changing. Topics such as agility, DevOps and automation strongly influence existing roles and areas of responsibility in software quality assurance as well as during the entire software life cycle. Standard testing and QA roles no longer exist in many (project) organisations. Dedicated testing teams are increasingly a thing of the past.\n\nWhat does this mean for people in these roles and with these responsibilities? Is there no room for them anymore? Are their skills and expertise no longer needed?\n\nDevOps is often equated with automation. Is DevOps responsible for automating employees out of a job? What is behind the hype and who or what is DevOps actually?\n\nPia Wiedermayer, Head of Quality Assurance https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/piawiedermayer\/, and Romano Roth, Head of DevOps, at Z\u00fchlke Switzerland tackle these questions. They talk about the challenges in their projects, examine roles and tasks and reveal new paths for professional and personal development. They also discuss ways to incorporate the wealth of experience of testers into the agile team culture and whether automation is the new testing.\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac T I M E S T A M P S \u23f0  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n00:00 Introduction\n00:19 How is your project?\n01:18 How was it in the past? \n01:53 How is it today? \n02:53 Does DevOps help?\n03:23 What do you think about that? \n03:49 What is DevOps?\n04:33 Who is DevOps? \n05:00 Your role in the past\n05:26 Your role in the future\n06:06 How to automate? \n08:00 1.

SSH or Secure Shell is a cryptographic network protocol designed for secure data communication. It is often used in passwordless authentication scenarios, improving the productivity and security of developers.\n\nWorking with Azure DevOps, an all-inclusive suite of development tools provided by Microsoft, can be significantly enhanced by using SSH. Azure DevOps comprises various services including Azure Repos, which is a set of version control tools that help developers manage their code. Azure Repos is versatile in that it supports both Git and Team Foundation Version Control.\n\nOne of the ways to interact with Azure Repos is using Git, a popular open-source version control system. When using Git with Azure Repos, developers have the flexibility to work with their codebase using various Git clients, including the popular VS Code. However, to establish a secure connection between these clients and Azure Repos, proper authentication is crucial.\n\nThis is where SSH comes in. Using SSH, you can authenticate to Azure DevOps, and particularly, Azure Git Repositories, without entering your username and password every time. This not only saves time but also minimizes the risk of your credentials being exposed.\n\nThis guide aims to help developers configure SSH for Azure DevOps, understand how to clone Azure Git Repos using SSH, and embrace passwordless and public key authentication methods for seamless and secure operations. Whether you're an IT professional, software engineer, or someone interested in learning about DevOps, this information will equip you with valuable insights into SSH integration and usage.\n\nThis video is about:-\nSSH Authentication\nAzure DevOps Tutorials\nAzure Repos\nAzure Git Repositories \nVS Code with Azure DevOps\nGit Authentication\nClone Azure Git Repo with SSH\nHow to use SSH authentication with Azure DevOps \nSsh passwordless authentication\nSsh with public key authentication \nUsing SSH to authenticate Git in Azure DevOps\nClone git Repository using SSH in Azure DevOps\n\n#AzureDevOps #git #softwareengineering",

        "videoDescription":"Dive into the transformative world of DevOps in the embedded industry with me. This video brings to life my presentation from the DevOps Meetup in Munich on November 15, 2023, offering a deep dive into the evolution of software development methodologies and the pivotal role of DevOps in driving innovation.\n\nEmbark on a journey from the constrained waterfall methodologies to the agile landscape, where a product-centric approach addresses real customer needs. Discover the challenges that plague the industry, from legacy systems and budget constraints to the \"wall of confusion\" that disrupts effective collaboration. More than a strategy to overcome these hurdles, DevOps emerges as a culture of collaboration, inclusivity, and continuous improvement.\n\nExperience the power of DevOps through the success stories of industry giants like Tesla and SpaceX, illustrating how Agile and DevOps principles can elevate a company's market position. Gain insights into the essential capabilities for enhancing software delivery performance, inspired by the seminal book \"Accelerate.\"\n\nLearn about the critical role of Platform Engineering and the Digital Factory model in embedding DevOps practices within product teams. This innovative approach not only simplifies the development process but also ensures consistency and fosters an environment ripe for continuous value delivery and breakthrough innovation.\n\nJoin me in this exploration of DevOps' potential to revolutionize the embedded industry, paving the way for future advancements.

Request only private parallel jobs unless you have a valid reason for public jobs.\n\nApproval Timeframe: It typically takes 24 to 48 hours for Microsoft to approve parallel job requests.\n\nVerification: After approval, you can verify the availability of parallel jobs in the Azure DevOps portal under the \"Parallel Jobs\" section in the billing settings.\n\nBilling Setup for Additional Jobs: For additional parallel jobs, users need an active Azure subscription (e.g., Pay-As-You-Go), and setup billing, linking it to the Azure subscription. This will allow for purchasing more parallel jobs if needed.\n\n\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83c\udfeb This complete tutorial is compiled by Sandeep Soni, a Microsoft Certified Trainer, a Software & Corporate Trainer for 27years!  \nFor more Training Courses Visit: https:\/\/www.bestitcourses.com\n\n\ud83d\udcf2 \ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf0\ud835\ude01 \ud835\ude04\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf5 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff\ud83d\udc4b \nCall Sandeep Soni for Career Guidance \u25ba +91 98490 01840 \nConnect with me on LINKEDIN \u25ba https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/sandeepsoni123\/ \n \n\ud83d\udc4d \ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb'\ud835\ude01 \ud835\uddd9\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf4\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude01 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddfc \n- Like the video if you found it helpful. \n- Subscribe to our channel for more DevOps tutorials and certification guides. \n- Hit the bell icon to get notified of our latest videos. \n\n\ud83d\udcac Join the Conversation \nHave questions or need further clarification?

        "videoDescription":"Start your DevOps Career (Beginners - Advanced) - https:\/\/bit.ly\/DevOpsLearningPath-YT\n\nDevOps is a buzzword. It\u2019s huge right now in the tech community, and it\u2019s definitely becoming more central to how teams build software.\nIf you\u2019re starting with DevOps, this video will help you understand the basics and give you a good head-start on your journey. You will also learn about the different stages in DevOps, what tools are needed at each stage, and how potential problems should be handled.\n\nStart your DevOps Career (Beginners - Advanced) - https:\/\/bit.ly\/DevOpsLearningPath-YT\n\nIn this video we will cover the following topics:\n\n00:00 -  Introduction\n00:27 - Problems before DevOps\n01:33 - Two Stages of DevOps\n02:12 - Real World Scenario 1\n03:28 - Real World Scenario 2\n04:12 - Automation\n05:06 - Benefits of DevOps\n06:10 - Summary\n07:22 - Conclusion\n \nThose new to the Programming and DevOps world often find it challenging to start their journey due to the missing basic prerequisites. For example, issues with setting up a basic lab environment using VirtualBox, problems with networking, or trouble with working with the Linux CLI or text editors like vi editor. Sometimes there are issues with applications - like getting a sample application to work, problems with getting the dependencies to install correctly or trouble with getting a web server to communicate with a database server. Or, at other times, it's working with data formats like JSON or YAML.\n\nSo we have identified a gap, and we believe that this is due to missing some of the basic prerequisites, such as knowing the basics of Linux, the basics of tools like VirtualBox, or knowing the basics of the most commonly used applications like Java, Python or NodeJS or web servers like Apache, NGINX etc. As a DevOps or Cloud Engineer, it is crucial to have these basics cleared. And that\u2019s why we are helping you to bridge that gap!\n\nWant to view a clear path to becoming a DevOps Engineer? Visit our website kodekloud.com!\nWe have various Learning Paths to help you choose your next step and shape your DevOps Career. \n\nCheck out our learning paths at KodeKloud to get started:\n\n -Linux: https:\/\/bit.ly\/LinuxLearningPath\n- DevOps Learning Path: https:\/\/bit.ly\/DevOpsLearningPath-YT\n -Docker: https:\/\/bit.ly\/DockerLearningPath\n -Kubernetes: https:\/\/bit.ly\/KubernetesLearningPath\n -Infrastructure as Code(IAC): https:\/\/bit.ly\/IACLearningPath\n -Programming: https:\/\/bit.ly\/ProgrammingLearningPath\n\nFor more updates on courses and tips, follow us on:\n-Website: https:\/\/kodekloud.com\/\n-LinkedIn: https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/kode...\n-Twitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/kodekloud1\n-Facebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/kodekloudtra...\n-Instagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/kodekloud\/\n-Blog: https:\/\/kodekloud.com\/blog\/\n\n#devops  #devopsengineer  #kodekloud",

        "videoDescription":"Today,  when  businesses  are  inclined  more towards  Agile  SDLC  methodology  for rapid and frequent deployments, sanity testing plays a crucial role. A manual way of performing sanity tests slow down the deployment process. Wouldn't it be great if we can automate this within the CI\/CD  process by performing headless testing using CLI commands and tools like Cycle?\n\nIn  this  video,  we  will  showcase  how  you  can  achieve  continuous  testing  by integrating  the  AWS  CI\/CD  process  (build  machine -Linux)  with  the  Cycle  test scripts. Also, understand how it enables end-users to decide on the level of impact on the end product and service deployed just by looking at the auto-generated test report, which helps in real agility.\n#devops #SDLC #CICD #AWS\n\nWe Love DevOps is a video series brought to you by Team Miracle.

Today we observe in the industry that software is written, integrated, and tested in long cycles. However, receiving feedback and experiencing the functionality of the software early and often is crucial to avoid issues. Vehicle DevOps is a way of creating a constant development flow with short feedback cycles. In this talk Michael Fait highlights current challenges for in-vehicle software development, introduces the concept of Vehicle Devops, and discusses its approaches to increase engineering effectiveness.\n\nMichael Fait, Head of Autonomous Vehicle Tech, Thoughtworks",

Book a call with me here \ud83d\udc49 https:\/\/stan.store\/outofdevops Today we'll be discussing the differences between DevOps and platform engineering. \n\nThere are various definitions for DevOps and Platform Engineering. This video will be mainly based on my experiences as software engineer working in the DevOps\/platform engineering space for the past few years.\n\nDevOps is a set of practices that aims to bridge the gap between development (dev) and operations (ops) teams. The goal is to improve collaboration, and not have two silos with the dev team sitting on one side and the ops team sitting on the other.\n\nSo I have always seen devops as a mindset and just another fancy way of saying software engineer.\nFor me the goal has always been to build cross-functional teams to reduce dependencies in organisations.\nThis concept has been popularised by the AWS mantra \"You build it you run it\" where you have the need for teams with T shaped or even better V shaped engineers.\n\nThe DevOps approach works well but when you start having several teams each implementing different ways of going to production you are solving the same problem multiple times.\nAlso these solutions need to be maintained and it's a full time job.\n\nPlatform engineering focuses on building and maintaining the infrastructure and the systems that supports applications and services. \nTheir goal is to support developers in the organisation by creating and maintaining the platform. Developers are the consumers and customers of the platform (Product).\n\nIDP stands for internal developer platform. And it's the way developer interface with the toolchain in their organisation.\nThe goal is to have teams using a self-service portal to support their application throughout the SDLC\n\n#devops #platformengineering\n\nWHO AM I:\nHey friends, welcome to my YouTube channel  @outofdevops  .

We\u2019ll talk about this new project\u2019s journey to 1.0, the range of hosting platforms it supports, and why it\u2019s not just for beginners.\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac About the podcast \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\nThis video is the uncut, live recording of the Talk Python To Me podcast ( https:\/\/talkpython.fm ).

Because your developers can access it using their personal accounts, which are not tied to a corporate identity. That makes it difficult for IT to control access. And because contributors can sign the author field of a commit with anything they like, IT can\u2019t track who is really authoring these commits.\n\nJust as bad, contributors are committing code on unauthorized machines, often without even logging into the Git web service, evading all access controls.\n\nThis leaves your software components vulnerable to unauthorized access and tampering, which can lead to malicious code getting distributed to all of your clients.\n\nWith Secure DevOps by Beyond Identity, you can ensure that only your developers check in code to your repo. And that all commits came from an authorized user and device. All without impacting software velocity.",

Book a call with me here \ud83d\udc49 https:\/\/stan.store\/outofdevops In this video, I am going to share my personal journey from application development to DevOps engineering and provide tips on how you can make the transition too. I started as a software engineer, coding applications, but soon realised there was more to it than just writing code. This curiosity led me to explore the DevOps space.\n\nTo break down the vast field of DevOps, focus on learning the software development lifecycle and understanding the role of a platform team working in the DevOps space. Grasping essential concepts like continuous integration (CI), automating steps from the developer machine to production, ensuring application reliability and security, and keeping up with new tools will help you excel in this field.\n\nRemember, you'll never be done learning in the DevOps space, as there's always something new to master. Companies use different tools, so don't worry about knowing everything. What truly matters is your motivation and willingness to learn. Embrace the process of constant growth and pushing yourself out of your comfort zone.\n\nIf you're ready for the challenge, you've made the right decision to enter the DevOps space. But if not, reconsider your choices, as building and updating your skills is an ongoing process in this field.

We also discuss Sonar Cloud and many other subjects.\n\nCheck out the full post covering this here:\nhttps:\/\/debugagent.com\/continuous-integration-github-actions-sonar-cloud\n\nThe project presented in the video is here:\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/shai-almog\/HelloJHipster\n\nIn this series we will learn the concepts of DevOps from a perspective of developers. How can these concepts help us be better developers and managers in our day to day jobs. In a startup you might need to fill the shoes of a DevOps, in a big company you might need to communicate with a DevOps team that has wildly different ideas.\n\nWe will gain a different perspective and understanding of the entire process by leaving our comfort zone and focusing on the wider picture. We will learn about different disciplines such as platform engineering and so much more.\n\n\u2705  You can see the article that goes with this post here: https:\/\/debugagent.com\/devops-for-developers-introduction-and-version-control\n\n\u2705  Check out the full series in the blog here: https:\/\/debugagent.com\/series\/devops4dev\n\n\u2705  Check out the playlist for this series here: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2HatFLh4xoA&list=PL8GhfcywW9YOA5i7kEFdNYFuluotS2JTZ\n\n\u2705  Check out https:\/\/debugagent.com\/ for other great content.\n\nTitle: DevOps 4 Devs - Continuous Integration, GitHub Actions & Sonar Cloud\n\n===============================\n\n\u2705  Subscribe To Channel For More Great Content on debugging and programming: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@debugagent \n\n\u2705  Stay Connected With Me.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Twitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/debugagent \n\ud83d\udc49 LinkedIn: https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/shai-almog-81a42\/ \n\ud83d\udc49 Website: https:\/\/debugagent.com\/ \n\ud83d\udc49 GitHub: https:\/\/github.com\/shai-almog \n\ud83d\udc49 Mastodon: https:\/\/mastodon.social\/@debugagent \n\n=============================\n\n\u2705  Recommended Playlists: \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Practical Debugging at Scale Course - Module 1: \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=A919j_5qE0k&list=PL8GhfcywW9YM3OsfxnaxAci6dJgkuOQWn \n\n\u2705  Other Videos You Might Be Interested In Watching: \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Practical Debugging at Scale Part 3: Watch and Evaluate   \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DGjVVKCNosM \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Practical Debugging at Scale Part 2: Program Control Flow   \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=GSeg5L31XXw \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Practical Debugging at Scale Part 1: Introduction   \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=A919j_5qE0k \n\n=============================\n\n\ud83d\udd14 Subscribe to our channel for more videos on debugging and programming: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@debugagent \n\n=================================\n\nDisclaimer: We do not accept any liability for any loss or damage which is incurred from you acting or not acting as a result of listening to any of our publications.

To learn more check out https:\/\/debugagent.com\/\n\nThis channel contains videos that comprise the first module covering debugging. Here we focus on IntelliJ\/IDEA and  Java\/JVM but the basic logic and tooling should be applicable to many other IDEs and platforms. We discuss debugging features that are niche and often unknown e.g.:\n\n* Marker Objects\n* Entry Renderers\n* Instance tracking\n* Memory object inspection\n* Tracepoints\/Logpoints\n\nand much more!\n\nBy leveraging these tools and techniques you will gain access to the secret weapon of senior developers and consultants. This will make you a better developer and a happier one. \n\nIn the following modules we cover:\n* Debugging Theory\n* Tooling\n* Writing Debuggable Code\n* Kubernetes (k8s)\n* Serverless\n* Fullstack\n* Observability \n\nThe full course includes more than 5 hours of video material.",

It's distributed so people around the world can share code\n2. It does version control\n\nSo, with version control, you can take snapshots of the state of your current code and maintain a history.\n\nBranching is really the third thing. Git branches allow developers to do isolated development and take chances without messing up the main branch.\n\nSo when someone asks me 'What is Git?', that is how I typically respond.",

        "videoDescription":"What is Git?\n\nHow would you define Git?\n\nWell, Git is a distributed version control system, which means two things:\n\n1. It's distributed so people around the world can share code\n2. It does version control\n\nSo, with version control, you can take snapshots of the state of your current code and maintain a history.\n\nBranching is really the third thing. Git branches allow developers to do isolated development and take chances without messing up the main branch.\n\nSo when someone asks me 'What is Git?', that is how I typically respond.",

How can these concepts help us be better developers and managers in our day to day jobs. In a startup you might need to fill the shoes of a DevOps, in a big company you might need to communicate with a DevOps team that has wildly different ideas.\n\nWe will gain a different perspective and understanding of the entire process by leaving our comfort zone and focusing on the wider picture. We will learn about different disciplines such as platform engineering and so much more.\n\nIn the first installment we discuss version control. As developers, we see it as a tool to collaborate and save our code. To track our mistakes and changes. In this video we learn why it's a crucial nexus point with the DevOps team and how we can work better to enable that.\n\n\u2705  You can see the article that goes with this post here: https:\/\/debugagent.com\/devops-for-developers-introduction-and-version-control\n\n\u2705  Check out the full series in the blog here: https:\/\/debugagent.com\/series\/devops4dev\n\n\u2705  Check out the playlist for this series here: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2HatFLh4xoA&list=PL8GhfcywW9YOA5i7kEFdNYFuluotS2JTZ\n\n\u2705  Check out https:\/\/debugagent.com\/ for other great content.\n\nTitle: DevOps 4 Devs-Introduction: Basic DevOps Tools & Version Control | git\n\n===============================\n\n\u2705  Subscribe To Channel For More Great Content on debugging and programming: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@debugagent \n\n\u2705  Stay Connected With Me.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Twitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/debugagent \n\ud83d\udc49 LinkedIn: https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/shai-almog-81a42\/ \n\ud83d\udc49 Website: https:\/\/debugagent.com\/ \n\ud83d\udc49 GitHub: https:\/\/github.com\/shai-almog \n\ud83d\udc49 Mastodon: https:\/\/mastodon.social\/@debugagent \n\n=============================\n\n\u2705  Recommended Playlists: \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Practical Debugging at Scale Course - Module 1: \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=A919j_5qE0k&list=PL8GhfcywW9YM3OsfxnaxAci6dJgkuOQWn \n\n\u2705  Other Videos You Might Be Interested In Watching: \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Practical Debugging at Scale Part 3: Watch and Evaluate   \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DGjVVKCNosM \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Practical Debugging at Scale Part 2: Program Control Flow   \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=GSeg5L31XXw \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Practical Debugging at Scale Part 1: Introduction   \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=A919j_5qE0k \n\n=============================\n\n\ud83d\udd14 Subscribe to our channel for more videos on debugging and programming: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@debugagent \n\n=================================\n\nDisclaimer: We do not accept any liability for any loss or damage which is incurred from you acting or not acting as a result of listening to any of our publications.

Over the past 1.5 years, I have been leveraging the power of podcasts to achieve this goal, inviting experienced professionals in the field to share their knowledge and insights with my audience.  My main agenda with this initiative is to build a testing mindset among students, as I believe that this is a crucial skill in today's software development landscape. By targeting those from less privileged backgrounds and areas, I hope to bridge the gap in knowledge and exposure to this field, opening up new opportunities for growth and development.

OPA provides a high-level declarative language that lets us specify policies as code and simple APIs to offload policy decision-making from our software. We can use OPA to enforce policies in microservices, Kubernetes, CI\/CD pipelines, API gateways, and more. \nIn kubernetes, OPA uses admission controllers.\n\nWhat is OPA Gatekeeper?\n\nOPA Gatekeeper is a specialized project providing first-class integration between OPA and Kubernetes.\nOPA Gatekeeper adds the following on top of plain OPA:\n\u25cf An extensible, parameterized policy library.\n\u25cf Native Kubernetes CRDs for instantiating the policy library (aka \u201cconstraints\u201d).\n\u25cf Native Kubernetes CRDs for extending the policy library (aka \u201cconstraint templates\u201d).\n\u25cf Audit functionality.\n\nWhy you need Gatekeeper?\n\nAs a Platform DevOps engineer managing multiple Kubernetes clusters for various projects, you face challenges when users deploy applications without adhering to best practices. Key issues include:\n  1.     Lack of ownership unless users apply labels themselves.\n  2.     No resource limits, leading to high costs.\n  3.     Untrusted images impacting other applications.\n  4.     Security and best practice violations across clusters.\n\nTo address these, we need governance to enforce limits and rules via policies. OPA Gatekeeper can be configured to implement these policies, ensuring best practices are followed.\n\nFollow my mentors too : @PavanElthepu    @MPrashant   @GouravSharma   @cloudwithraj   @AntonPutra   @AbhishekVeeramalla   @kubesimplify   @kshindi   @DevOpsJourney \n\nTags : #prometheus   #secrets #docker  #k8s #kubernetes #cncf #rbac #serverless #grafana #autoscaling #deployment  #opensource #devops #grafana #vault #terraform #kustomize #etcd #controlplane #container #opa #dockerhub #gatekeeper",

        "videoDescription":"CHECK OUT MY DEVOPS COURSE WITH 85% OFF COUPON AT https:\/\/sre.rs\n\nHello everyone,\n\n\nI've made a DevOps course covering a lot of different technologies and applications,\naimed at startups, small companies and individuals who want to self-host\ntheir infrastructure.\n\nThis video shows the first part of setting up WireGuard VPN.\n\nTL;DR:\nCourse page: https:\/\/www.udemy.com\/course\/real-world-devops-project-from-start-to-finish\/?referralCode=9AC467077593D22878A2\nDiscount coupon is available at https:\/\/sre.rs\n\nDetails:\nTo get this out of the way - this course doesn't cover Kubernetes or similar -\nI'm of the opinion that for startups, small companies, and especially individuals,\nyou probably don't need Kubernetes. Unless you have a whole DevOps team,\nit usually brings more problems than benefits, and unnecessary infrastructure bills\nburied a lot of startups before they got anywhere.\n\nAs for prerequisites, you can't be a complete beginner in the world of computers.\nIf you've never even heard of Docker, if you don't know at least something about DNS,\nor if you don't have any experience with Linux, this course is probably not for you.\nThat being said, I do explain the basics too, but probably not in enough detail\nfor a complete beginner.\n\nI encourage you to watch \"free preview\" videos to get the sense of what\nwill be covered, but here's the gist:\n\nThe goal of the course is to create an easily deployable and reproducible server\nwhich will have \"everything\" a startup or a small company will need - VPN, mail, Git,\nCI\/CD, messaging, hosting websites and services, sharing files, calendar, etc.\nIt can also be useful to individuals who want to self-host all of those - I ditched Google 99.9%\nand other than that being a good feeling, I'm not worried that some AI bug will lock my account\nwith no one to talk to about resolving the issue.\n\nConsidering that it covers a wide variety of topics, it doesn't go in depth in any of those.\nThink of it as going down a highway towards the end destination, but on the way there I show you\nall the junctions where I think it's useful to do more research on the subject.\n\nWe'll deploy services inside Docker and LXC (Linux Containers). Those will include\na mail server (iRedMail), Zulip (Slack and Microsoft Teams alternative), GitLab (with GitLab Runner and CI\/CD),\nNextcloud (file sharing, calendar, contacts, etc.), checkmk (monitoring solution), Pi-hole (ad blocking on DNS level),\nTraefik with Docker and file providers (a single HTTP\/S entry point with automatic routing and TLS certificates).\n\nWe'll set up WireGuard, a modern and fast VPN solution for secure access to VPS' internal network,\nand I'll also show you how to get a wildcard TLS certificate with certbot and DNS provider.\n\nTo wrap it all up, we'll write a simple Python application that will compare a list of the desired backups\nwith the list of finished backups, and send a result to a Zulip stream.\nWe'll write the application, do a 'git push' to GitLab which will trigger a CI\/CD pipeline\nthat will build a Docker image, push it to a private registry, and then,\nwith the help of the GitLab runner, run it on the VPS and post a result to a Zulip stream with a webhook.\n\n\nIf you apply the coupon, I'd appreciate if you leave your feedback on Udemy\nafter you're done and spread the word about the course. It would mean a lot.\n\n\nI hope that you find it useful.\n\n\nHappy learning,\nPredrag",

        "videoDescription":"Eli's talk at DevOpsDays Raleigh focused on automating license checks in CI\/CD pipelines. Of course, the topic of open source licenses is fascinating to the All Things Open community and we wanted to learn more. During this interview, we talked with Eli about the importance of open source licensing, in particular, how they are automating license enforcement. Then we discussed some trends in DevOps from the perspective of a former DevOps engineer and manager.\n\nRegistration for All Things Open 2024 is now open. Register now to save your spot: https:\/\/allthingsopen.org\/ato-registration-now-open\n\n0:00 - Introduction\n0:08 - Welcome Eli Birger\n0:40 - Tell us about yourself\n2:10 - Can you share a few key takeaways that you shared with the audience here? \n3:28 - Why are open source licenses important?\n4:16 - What's happening in DevOps, a topic, a trend, a debate, that people should be aware of?\n5:09 - What's one piece of advice that you want to share with the All Things Open community?\n\nKey takeaways:\n* We publicly share  the CI\/CD enforcement we built for different types of licenses\n* The topic of open source licenses is very complex and very boring\n* The volume of licenses complicates the space\n* Be aware of \"blind spots\" in your processes and methodology\n* Do not take things for granted and challenge everything\n* Invest at least one hour a day for learning and challenging things\n\n###\nAbout Eli Birger \nEli is a passionate technologist with a background in telecom, cyber, and storage. He has over six years of experience as a DevOps Manager, where he specialized in building large-scale SaaS systems based on Kubernetes. As the CTO at PerfectScales, his current focus is on building solutions that solve the pains of operating highly-disturbed Kubernetes systems, keeping them running both efficiently and resiliently.\n\nAbout All Things Open\nAll Things Open is a universe of open source events and platforms designed to educate and connect technologists around the world.
