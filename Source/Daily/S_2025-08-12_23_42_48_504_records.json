In this video, Liz and Seth discuss the differences and similarities between DevOps and SRE, ultimately realizing that DevOps and SRE aren't two competing methods, but rather close friends designed help break down organizational barriers to deliver better software faster. DevOps is like an abstract class in programming, and SRE is one possible implementation of that class.\n\nSite Reliability Engineering: https:\/\/goo.gl\/aCiiPV\nHow SRE relates to DevOps: https:\/\/goo.gl\/NWKuj9\nManaging Deployments with Kubernetes Engine Qwiklab: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2zdFQh5\n\nReach out to Liz and Seth:\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/sethvargo\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/lizthegrey\n\nWatch more episodes from the playlist here: https:\/\/goo.gl\/CKv3tV\nSubscribe to the Google Cloud Platform channel for more Cloud content: https:\/\/goo.gl\/S0AS51",

        "videoDescription":"Differences and Overlaps of Cloud and DevOps Engineer Roles as well as deep dive of Cloud Engineer Tasks and Responsibilities\n\nDevOps engineer and Cloud engineer are 2 popular roles in software engineering. But there is a lot of mix up of these two roles and many people and many companies often use them interchangeably. They mix the tasks and responsibilities of these two very often. For example there are plenty of job descriptions for \"DevOps Cloud Engineer\" or \"Cloud DevOps Engineer\", which would naturally make you think that they are the same role, but then why would you have two names for the same role? And that's exactly what I'm going to discuss and clarify in this video.\n\n\n\ud83d\udd17\ud83d\udca1  What is DevOps and DevOps Engineer Tasks and Responsibilities\n                                                                                                     \u25ba  https:\/\/youtu.be\/0yWAtQ6wYNM\n\ud83d\udd17\ud83d\udca1  From Zero to DevOps Engineer - Roadmap              \u25ba   https:\/\/youtu.be\/G_nVMUtaqCk\n\ud83d\udd17\ud83d\ude80  Become a DevOps Engineer in 6 months                 \u25ba   https:\/\/bit.ly\/3BPxlGf\n\ud83d\udd17\ud83d\ude80  Become a Kubernetes Administrator                        \u25ba   https:\/\/youtu.be\/pDrjQWo3CxI\n\ud83d\udd17\ud83d\ude80  Become a DevSecOps Expert and 10x your value  \u25ba   https:\/\/bit.ly\/45gUXQU\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Thank you JetBrains for sponsoring this video \ud83d\udc4f  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\nHow to Use the Space Git Flow With TeamCity \u2013 https:\/\/jb.gg\/space_git_flow \nGet started with Space for free \u2013 https:\/\/jb.gg\/jetbrains_space\nTry TeamCity for CI\/CD \u2013 https:\/\/jb.gg\/jetbrains_teamcity\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac T I M E S T A M P S \u23f0  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n0:00 - Intro and why people mix up these two roles?\n01:47 - DevOps Engineer role\n02:46 - Different Objectives of DevOps and Cloud Engineer\n04:02 - The need for Cloud Engineers\n08:42 - Cloud Engineer Task: Configure with Best Practices\n10:35 - Cloud Platform specific knowledge\n13:36 - More Cloud Engineer Tasks and Responsibilities\n15:58 - Infrastructure as Code\n17:10 - Differences between DevOps and Cloud Engineer\n17:39 - Overlaps between Cloud and DevOps Engineer \n20:25 - Wrap Up\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Want to learn more? \ud83d\ude80  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nFull Python course                                            \u25ba  https:\/\/youtu.be\/t8pPdKYpowI\nFull Docker course                                            \u25ba  https:\/\/youtu.be\/3c-iBn73dDE\nFull K8s course                                                  \u25ba  https:\/\/youtu.be\/X48VuDVv0do\nDevOps Tools explained                                   \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/2W9UEq6\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Connect with me \ud83d\udc4b   \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nLINKEDIN                           \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/3hWOLVT\nINSTAGRAM                      \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/2F3LXYJ\nTWITTER                            \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/3i54PUB\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Courses & Ebooks & Bootcamp \ud83d\ude80      \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \n\u25ba Become a DevOps Engineer - full educational program             \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc   https:\/\/bit.ly\/45mXaer\n\u25ba High-Quality and Hands-On Courses                                             \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc   https:\/\/bit.ly\/3BNS8Kv\n\u25ba Kubernetes 101 - compact and easy-to-read ebook bundle      \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc   https:\/\/bit.ly\/3Ozl28x",

There is a lot of discussion going on, where some people are asking whether platform engineering replaces DevOps. Many people say it goes hand in hand and is rather an addition to DevOps, but in reality it's a bit more complicated than that. Platform engineering actually changes a lot of established rules we knew about DevOps, SRE and Cloud engineering, it changes the game and introduces some new rules.\n\nSo let's clearly define, what platform engineering exactly is, more interestingly, why was there even a need for this new role and how it evolved and of course how it compares to DevOps and Cloud engineering and does it really replace any of these roles?\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac T I M E S T A M P S \u23f0  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n0:00 - Intro and Overview\n0:50 - Why Platform Engineering?

        "videoDescription":"Looking for the ultimate guide to DevOps Tools? Look no further! In this video we\u2019ll break down and explain the essential DevOps tools needed to streamline your development workflows.\n\n\n\nDevOps is a software engineering culture and practice that aims to unify software development (Dev) and software operation (Ops). The main goal of DevOps is to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. \n\nDevOps is accomplished through several tools that help automate processes and improve collaboration between development and operations teams.\n\nSome standard DevOps tools include: \n-Version control systems (e.g. Git) \n-Continuous integration tools (e.g. Jenkins) \n-Containerisation platforms (e.g. Docker) \n-Monitoring tools (e.g. Nagios, Zabbix) \n-Configuration management tools (e.g. Ansible, Puppet) \n-Test automation tools (e.g. Selenium) \n-Project management tools (e.g. JIRA)\n\n\n\nThese are the topics covered in this video: \n00:00 - An Introduction to DevOps Tools\n00:50 - DevOps Tools - A Comprehensive Overview \n04:45 - Git vs GitHub \n08:05 - CI\/CD Tools \n10:20 - Docker \n11:31 - Kubernetes \n13:09 - Terraform \n14:16 - Ansible \n15:20 - Prometheus and Grafana \n15:50 - A summary of the DevOps tools and next steps\n\n\u2705Interested in learning more about Kubernetes, be sure to check out our Kubernetes Learning Path on KodeKloud: https:\/\/bit.ly\/KubernetesLearningPath .

We will set up a build pipeline which creates a build artifact that can be used in the Release pipeline. I will set up multiple environments (Dev and Test) and show how to progress the function through the different stages. The Azure Function uses an environment value, which we will set up using Azure Variable groups and pass it as Application settings to Azure infrastructure. \n\nNew to Azure DevOps? \nGet Started here - https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=prqW7DVVxLM\n\nAdditional Watching: \nAzure DevOps Playlist - https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PL59L9XrzUa-m7AFDgjWuwm6exyCklc03U\n\nCome say hi! \u270b\nBlog - https:\/\/rahulpnath.com\/\nTwitter - https:\/\/twitter.com\/rahulpnath\nInstagram - https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/rahulpnath\/\n\nMy YouTube Recording Setup - https:\/\/www.rahulpnath.com\/blog\/youtube_setup_and_workflow\/\n\nMake sure to SUBSCRIBE to the channel.

        "videoDescription":"Hello Friends,  Code review is an essential practice of the development life cycle. It helps improve the code quality, unify team practices, share knowledge, mentoring, etc. over a longer period of time. It helps find mistakes that are overlooked while developing and helps improve the overall quality of the software. This helps accelerate the deployment process as changes are more likely to pass through testing. Raising Pull Requests (PR) lets your team review code and give feedback on changes before merging it into the master branch. Reviewers can step through the proposed changes, leave comments, and vote to approve or reject the code.\n\nIn this video, I will show you how to raise a Pull Request (PR) in Azure DevOps, associate work items, add reviewers. I then wear the reviewer's hat and show how to add comments to the PR, raise suggestions (that can be applied directly from DevOps), and approve or reject the PR. \n\nAs a team,  it is a good practice to set branch policies to ensure only reviewed code gets merged into your main development branch. I will show how to set branch policies, automatically add reviewers to the PR, and set automated builds on raising PR.\n\n\ud83c\udf0dMaking Code Reviews Effective - https:\/\/www.rahulpnath.com\/blog\/code-review\/\n\ud83d\udcf9 Build\/Deploy Pipeline for the MyApp https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FFxww1-M25E\n\nAdditional Watching: \n\ud83d\udcf9Getting Started With Azure DevOps - https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=prqW7DVVxLM\n\ud83d\udcf9Azure DevOps Playlist - https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PL59L9XrzUa-m7AFDgjWuwm6exyCklc03U\n\nCome say hi! \u270b\n\ud83c\udf0d Blog - https:\/\/rahulpnath.com\/\n\u2709 Subscribe to my Newsletter - https:\/\/www.rahulpnath.com\/subscribe\n\ud83d\udc26Twitter - https:\/\/twitter.com\/rahulpnath\n\ud83d\udcf8Instagram - https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/rahulpnath\/\n\n\ud83c\udfa5 Recording Setup and Workflow - https:\/\/www.rahulpnath.com\/blog\/youtube_setup_and_workflow\/\n\nMake sure to SUBSCRIBE to the channel.

Sometimes there are issues with applications - like getting a sample application to work, problems with getting the dependencies to install correctly or trouble with getting a web server to communicate with a database server. Or, at other times, it's working with data formats like JSON or YAML.\n\nSo we have identified a gap, and we believe that this is due to missing some of the basic prerequisites, such as knowing the basics of Linux, the basics of tools like VirtualBox, or knowing the basics of the most commonly used applications like Java, Python or NodeJS or web servers like Apache, NGINX etc. As a DevOps or Cloud Engineer, it is crucial to have these basics cleared.

The core values of devops is effectively based on the Agile Manifesto but with one slight change which moves the focus from creating a working software to one that is more interested in the end-to-end software service mechanism and delivery.\n\nWhy Agile is important\n\nAgile Methodology is a development method in which requirements and solutions evolve in cross-functional teams through the collaborative effort.  Its approach aligns project and product development with requirements of the customer and overall company goals. It is a methodology based on iterative development. This process encourages frequent inspection and adaptation which helps in rapid delivery of high quality software. Agile methodology is developed for products and projects that require flexibility and speed- which actually means, almost every product and project which is being managed today.\n\n------------------------------\nFor more Information:\nPlease write us to sales@intellipaat.com, or call us at: +91- 7847955955\n\nWebsite: https:\/\/intellipaat.com\/devops-certification-training\/\n\nFacebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/intellipaatonline\n\nLinkedIn: https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/intellipaat\/\n\nTwitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/Intellipaat\n\nTelegram: https:\/\/t.me\/s\/Learn_with_Intellipaat\n\nInstagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/intellipaat",

        "videoDescription":"DevOps represents a significant step forward, or at least it can do. It is a powerful effective approach to software development and delivery but is easily and commonly misunderstood. DevOps tools and DevOps workflows are at the heart of the most effective approach to software engineering, but they are also commonly abused in practice by organisations that don\u2019t understand what this loosely defined set of practices really means. Here at Continuous Delivery, we think that a DevOps process is effective, but that \u201cDevOps\" is maybe not the best way to describe it. So is DevOps the same as Continuous Delivery, and which works best, in terms of software engineering to deliver better software faster?\n\nIn this episode, Dave Farley explores these ideas and more as he looks at the good and bad of DevOps. Which ideas are important, and can we learn from, which are misleading and confusing?\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\ud83d\udcda BOOKS:\n\n\ud83d\udcd6 Dave\u2019s NEW BOOK \"Modern Software Engineering\" is now available on \nAmazon \u27a1\ufe0f https:\/\/amzn.to\/3DwdwT3\nIn this book, Dave brings together his ideas and proven techniques to describe a durable, coherent and foundational approach to effective software development, for programmers, managers and technical leads, at all levels of experience.\n\n\ud83d\udcd6 \"Continuous Delivery Pipelines\" by Dave Farley\npaperback \u27a1\ufe0f https:\/\/amzn.to\/3gIULlA\nebook version \u27a1\ufe0f https:\/\/leanpub.com\/cd-pipelines\n\n\ud83d\udcd6 The original, award-winning \"Continuous Delivery\" book by Dave Farley and Jez Humble \n\u27a1\ufe0f https:\/\/amzn.to\/2WxRYmx\n\n\ud83d\udcd6  Accelerate, The science of Lean Software and DevOps, by Nicole Fosgren, Jez Humble & Gene Kim \u27a1\ufe0f https:\/\/amzn.to\/2YYf5Z8\n\n\ud83d\udcd6  The Phoenix Project, by Gene Kim \u27a1\ufe0f https:\/\/amzn.to\/3csuuop \n\n\ud83d\udcd6  The DevOps Handbook, by Gene Kim, Jez Humble, Patrick Debois & John Willis \u27a1\ufe0f  https:\/\/amzn.to\/2LsoPmr\n\nNOTE: If you click on one of the Amazon Affiliate links and buy the book, Continuous Delivery Ltd. will get a small fee for the recommendation with NO increase in cost to you.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlso from Dave:\n\n\ud83c\udf93 CD TRAINING COURSES \nIf you want to learn Continuous Delivery and DevOps skills, check out Dave Farley's courses \n\u27a1\ufe0f https:\/\/bit.ly\/DFTraining\n\n\ud83d\udce7 JOIN CD MAIL LIST \ud83d\udce7\nKeep up to date with the latest discussions, free \"How To...\" guides, events and online courses. \u27a1\ufe0f https:\/\/bit.ly\/MailListCD\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLINKS:\n\nState of DevOps report 2021 \u27a1\ufe0f https:\/\/services.google.com\/fh\/files\/misc\/state-of-devops-2021.pdf\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCHANNEL SPONSORS:\n\nEqual Experts is a product software development consultancy with a network of over 1,000 experienced technology consultants globally.

Proper on-device encryption, 2FA codes, logins, secrets - all mine and only mine. No compromises.\n\nThese are partner links - you won\u2019t pay a cent more, but you\u2019ll be supporting DevOps Compass.

        "videoDescription":"This video captures my presentation delivered at the DevOps Meetup in Z\u00fcrich on January 25, 2024, where I delve into the prevalent challenges faced by traditional DevOps methodologies, characterized by isolated teams and fragmented value streams that impede efficiency. It explores DevOps as a holistic culture, mindset, and suite of technical practices designed to foster continuous value delivery, prioritize products over projects, and focus on customer-centric development. Additionally, I introduce Platform Engineering as a strategic evolution of DevOps aimed at mitigating the technical and operational complexities encountered when scaling DevOps in larger enterprises. Highlighting a collaborative project with LGT and Z\u00fchlke, I present the Platform Plane case study, demonstrating how an internal developer platform can streamline and standardize DevOps processes across various teams, thereby reducing cognitive load and enhancing productivity. This presentation goes beyond theoretical discussion, offering a hands-on demonstration of the Platform Plane and its functionalities, including Kubernetes as a service, API gateway, and Service Mesh, among others. It illustrates the vital role of Platform Engineering in enabling product teams to adopt DevOps more efficiently and effectively, leading to an optimized development lifecycle.\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac T I M E S T A M P S \u23f0  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n00:00 Intro\n00:08 Welcome\n00:31 About me\n02:36 Today's challenges\n04:33 DevOps is here to help\n05:20 Who is DevOps?\n06:44 The Benefit of DevOps\n08:05 DevOps is bullshit?\n08:27 What are the Challenges with DevOps?\n08:59 You build it you run it\n10:18 Think about that on scale.\n11:06 Can you scale DevOps?\n11:23 Example of What companies want\n15:50 The Digital Factory \n16:35 Platform Engineering Enables DevOps in Product Teams.\n18:30 The Gartner Top Strategic Technology Trends for 2024. \n19:29 Platform Engineering Improves DevOps Efficiency.\n20:24 The Platform Plane: Big Picture.\n22:04 The Platform Plane: High Level Architecture\n21:56 Demo 1 - The Admin Areas\n25:56 Demo 2 - Platform Plane\n26:01 Platform Plane- Main page\n26:27 Documentations\n27:38 AI Assistant\n29:21 Platform plane:\n30:12 - GitLab\n30:44 - Repositories \n32:13 - Registry\n33:40 - Package Management\n36:42 - Hypervisor ( virtual machines)\n36:52 - Identity \n37:56- Chat\n39:07 Summary\n39:45 Outro\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac  L I N K S  \ud83d\udd17\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nPlatform Plane: \n\u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/rSUI6-R4DlM\n\nLGT: \n\u27a4 https:\/\/www.lgt.com\/\n\nZ\u00fchlke: \n\u27a4 https:\/\/www.zuehlke.com\/\n\nDevOps Meetup Z\u00fcrich: \n\u27a4 https:\/\/www.meetup.com\/devops-meetup-zurich\/\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Want to learn more? \ud83d\ude80  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \n\nYou're developing products, not projects \n\u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/ImbhUFr6suw?si=UeSOAR67hZcJWE5T\n\nDevOps \n\u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/Ath3XoLbYxY?si=xzJzs4Fqpst6uxqm\n\nApply continous testing and build-in quality \n\u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/W0QZRpf7ElM?si=oe54rFG0uEXtHUbJ\n\nApply continous security \n\u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/340YmM08Eb0?si=QFOGkCnUElDXevR-\n\nBuild a platform\n \u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/UE8mSt55xHw?si=cc6_S_6Wv6iwA_y1\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac  S U B S C R I B E  \ud83d\udd14 \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \n\u2554\u2550\u2566\u2557\u2554\u2566\u2557\u2554\u2550\u2566\u2550\u2566\u2566\u2566\u2566\u2557\u2554\u2550\u2557\n\u2551\u255a\u2563\u2551\u2551\u2551\u255a\u2563\u255a\u2563\u2554\u2563\u2554\u2563\u2551\u255a\u2563\u2550\u2563\n\u2560\u2557\u2551\u255a\u255d\u2551\u2551\u2560\u2557\u2551\u255a\u2563\u2551\u2551\u2551\u2551\u2551\u2550\u2563\n\u255a\u2550\u2569\u2550\u2550\u2569\u2550\u2569\u2550\u2569\u2550\u2569\u255d\u255a\u2569\u2550\u2569\u2550\u255d\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCXvlc9x4zlv5DEqbby55Ivg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Connect with me \ud83d\udc4b  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nLINKEDIN                  \u25ba https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/romanoroth\/\nTWITTER                   \u25ba https:\/\/twitter.com\/RomanoRoth\nINSTAGRAM             \u25ba https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/romanoroth\/\nFACEBOOK               \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/romanoroth\/\nMEETUP                   \u25ba https:\/\/www.meetup.com\/de-DE\/DevOps-Meetup-Zurich\/\nCONFERNCE            \u25bahttps:\/\/www.devopsdays.ch\/\nHOMEPAGE              \u25ba  https:\/\/www.romanoroth.com\/\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac  P L A Y L I S T S  \u25b6\ufe0f \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nModern Software Engineering\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLrsbMazVPK_rb56rZQr2fyBGR3cyanZpX\nDevOps\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLrsbMazVPK_ro3fn1G-3Ui2mBPHxOD9kF\nGitLab: Build a DevSecOps Pipeline\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLrsbMazVPK_qhf3ahA_zRPlwBaGGhSu2P\n\n#devsecops  #devops #romanoroth #platformengineering",

Request only private parallel jobs unless you have a valid reason for public jobs.\n\nApproval Timeframe: It typically takes 24 to 48 hours for Microsoft to approve parallel job requests.\n\nVerification: After approval, you can verify the availability of parallel jobs in the Azure DevOps portal under the \"Parallel Jobs\" section in the billing settings.\n\nBilling Setup for Additional Jobs: For additional parallel jobs, users need an active Azure subscription (e.g., Pay-As-You-Go), and setup billing, linking it to the Azure subscription. This will allow for purchasing more parallel jobs if needed.\n\n\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83c\udfeb This complete tutorial is compiled by Sandeep Soni, a Microsoft Certified Trainer, a Software & Corporate Trainer for 27years!  \nFor more Training Courses Visit: https:\/\/www.bestitcourses.com\n\n\ud83d\udcf2 \ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf0\ud835\ude01 \ud835\ude04\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf5 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff\ud83d\udc4b \nCall Sandeep Soni for Career Guidance \u25ba +91 98490 01840 \nConnect with me on LINKEDIN \u25ba https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/sandeepsoni123\/ \n \n\ud83d\udc4d \ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb'\ud835\ude01 \ud835\uddd9\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf4\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude01 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddfc \n- Like the video if you found it helpful. \n- Subscribe to our channel for more DevOps tutorials and certification guides. \n- Hit the bell icon to get notified of our latest videos. \n\n\ud83d\udcac Join the Conversation \nHave questions or need further clarification?

It\u2019s huge right now in the tech community, and it\u2019s definitely becoming more central to how teams build software.\nIf you\u2019re starting with DevOps, this video will help you understand the basics and give you a good head-start on your journey. You will also learn about the different stages in DevOps, what tools are needed at each stage, and how potential problems should be handled.\n\nStart your DevOps Career (Beginners - Advanced) - https:\/\/bit.ly\/DevOpsLearningPath-YT\n\nIn this video we will cover the following topics:\n\n00:00 -  Introduction\n00:27 - Problems before DevOps\n01:33 - Two Stages of DevOps\n02:12 - Real World Scenario 1\n03:28 - Real World Scenario 2\n04:12 - Automation\n05:06 - Benefits of DevOps\n06:10 - Summary\n07:22 - Conclusion\n \nThose new to the Programming and DevOps world often find it challenging to start their journey due to the missing basic prerequisites. For example, issues with setting up a basic lab environment using VirtualBox, problems with networking, or trouble with working with the Linux CLI or text editors like vi editor. Sometimes there are issues with applications - like getting a sample application to work, problems with getting the dependencies to install correctly or trouble with getting a web server to communicate with a database server. Or, at other times, it's working with data formats like JSON or YAML.\n\nSo we have identified a gap, and we believe that this is due to missing some of the basic prerequisites, such as knowing the basics of Linux, the basics of tools like VirtualBox, or knowing the basics of the most commonly used applications like Java, Python or NodeJS or web servers like Apache, NGINX etc. As a DevOps or Cloud Engineer, it is crucial to have these basics cleared. And that\u2019s why we are helping you to bridge that gap!\n\nWant to view a clear path to becoming a DevOps Engineer? Visit our website kodekloud.com!\nWe have various Learning Paths to help you choose your next step and shape your DevOps Career. \n\nCheck out our learning paths at KodeKloud to get started:\n\n -Linux: https:\/\/bit.ly\/LinuxLearningPath\n- DevOps Learning Path: https:\/\/bit.ly\/DevOpsLearningPath-YT\n -Docker: https:\/\/bit.ly\/DockerLearningPath\n -Kubernetes: https:\/\/bit.ly\/KubernetesLearningPath\n -Infrastructure as Code(IAC): https:\/\/bit.ly\/IACLearningPath\n -Programming: https:\/\/bit.ly\/ProgrammingLearningPath\n\nFor more updates on courses and tips, follow us on:\n-Website: https:\/\/kodekloud.com\/\n-LinkedIn: https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/kode...\n-Twitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/kodekloud1\n-Facebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/kodekloudtra...\n-Instagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/kodekloud\/\n-Blog: https:\/\/kodekloud.com\/blog\/\n\n#devops  #devopsengineer  #kodekloud",

The main focus will be on the new Azure Managed DevOps Agent Pools, what they are, how they work, and why you might want to use them.\n\nWe\u2019ll start by deploying some prerequisites using Terraform, including a virtual network to host our agents. You\u2019ll see how to use the AzAPI provider to get the job done and I\u2019ll walk you through it all, step by step, as we build this Terraform project from scratch.\n\nOnce everything is up and running, we\u2019ll connect our agent to an Azure Pipeline and run a deployment to test it out.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to automate Azure DevOps agent pool provisioning with Terraform and AzAPI, or just want to learn more about CI\/CD in Azure, you\u2019re in the right place.

It's distributed so people around the world can share code\n2. It does version control\n\nSo, with version control, you can take snapshots of the state of your current code and maintain a history.\n\nBranching is really the third thing. Git branches allow developers to do isolated development and take chances without messing up the main branch.\n\nSo when someone asks me 'What is Git?', that is how I typically respond.",

Platform Engineering focusses on the building the infrastructure and the systems that are needed for running your applications and supporting your application throughout the software life cycle.

That's typically the config stuff in the hidden .git folder, including things like:\n\n- Refspec\n-Packfiles\n- The HEAD Pointer\n- Git References\n- Remote References\n- Transfer Protocols\n- Garbage Collector\n- Recovery files\n- Tree Objects\n- Environment variables\n\nHopefully you don't have to get your hands dirty with the Git plumbing too often. It's nice to stick with the Git porcelain.\n\nBut at the same time, plumbers do make a lot of money!",

Hit the bell icon to stay updated with our latest videos.\n\nFor Interview related training please feel free to reach us over the call 9845421738 to discuss further.\n\nI am gonna tell you what DevOps engineers do in less than a minute with an example.\n\nIn a restaurant kitchen, there are chefs and wait staff.\n\nChefs are responsible for creating and experimenting with new dishes. Their job includes coming up with innovative recipes, testing them, and adding the successful ones to the menu. At the same time, they also prepare food to meet the regular demand of customers who visit the restaurant daily. This dual responsibility of innovation and ongoing service can become overwhelming, especially during busy hours when the kitchen is already at full capacity.\n\nWait staff, on the other hand, focus on delivering the prepared food to customers. Their primary role is to ensure that the food reaches the diners promptly and in perfect condition, keeping the restaurant\u2019s operations running smoothly.\n\nExperimenting with a new dish during peak hours, however, becomes a significant challenge. The process of testing new recipes while maintaining the flow of regular orders often leads to disruptions in the kitchen, causing delays and dissatisfaction among customers.\n\nTo address this, the restaurant hires a kitchen manager. The kitchen manager creates a separate small kitchen dedicated to experimenting with new dishes. This ensures that the chefs can focus on their innovations without interfering with the ongoing operations. Once a dish is perfected, the kitchen manager introduces automation, such as using a conveyor belt, to streamline the cooking process. This allows the new dish to be produced efficiently alongside the existing menu items while ensuring there are no interruptions in serving food to the restaurant's customers.\n\nYes, DevOps engineers are none other than automation experts.\n\n#devops #devopsengineer #careerguidance  #newvlog  #trendingreels \n\nroles and responsibilities devops engineer\ndoes devops engineer need coding\nwhat is devops for beginners\nroles of a devops engineer\njob description of devops engineer\nrequirements for devops engineer\nskills required for devops engineer\ndefinition of devops engineer\n@Ajayhr_01",

HELLO WORLD?  \nCan anybody hear me behind the firewall...?  \n404 soul not found...\n\n(Verse 1) \nPush to prod at 3 A.M.,  \nBrain\u2019s a loop in mayhem,  \nTold myself \u201cjust one more line,\u201d  \nNow it\u2019s been seven sprints of crime.  \n\nGIT RESET --HARD!!\n\nDon\u2019t forget to update your dependencies...  \nYou wrote that logic at 2 A.M... it's trash...  \nKevin force-pushed again...\n\nYou ever deploy a microservice and pray it doesn\u2019t become a macro-disaster?  \nMy Docker container\u2019s the only thing holding me together.  \nI tried therapy once... then Jira assigned me 14 more tickets.  \nMy manager said: \u201cJust estimate in story points.\u201d  \nI said: haa\n\n(Chorus)\nHello world, hello pain,  \nIs this loop recursive or am I insane?  \nFrom Python dreams to Java screams,  \nMy RAM is low... and so are my hopes.\n\nAgile... agile... agile...  \nDeliverable... agile...\n\n(Verse 2) \nNull pointer stabbed me in the back,  \nKubernetes launched a DDoS attack.  \nStack Overflow won\u2019t answer me,  \nEven GPT said: \u201cYo bro, I\u2019d flee.\u201d\n\nBUILD FAILED!!!\n\n(Bridge)\nOne commit to rule them all...  \nOne Slack ping begins my fall...  \nYou're on-call this weekend... forever...\n\nDid you test it?  \nIt works on my machine!  \nKevin deleted the prod DB!  \nWhy is prod even accessible from the dashboard?!  \nHugOps... HugOps... HugOps...\n\nHow did I become this...?  \nI just wanted to build an app that makes cat noises...\n\n(Final Chorus)\nOhhhh HELLO WOOORLD, my sanity\u2019s gone,  \nThese tickets keep respawning at dawn.  \nManager says we\u2019re agile and fast,  \nBut this sprint\u2019s a dumpster fire blast.\n\nNOT ON PROOOOOOD!!\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n\ud83d\udd14 Like what you hear?

The greatest experts, like Jiro who's been making sushi daily for 80 years straight, understand something most technologists never grasp.\n\nThis is an excerpt from the \ud83c\udf71 DevOps Sushi - Part 1 \ud83c\udfac movie that is now available on https:\/\/makeitwork.tv.

        "videoDescription":"#DevOps has enabled digital transformation. In fifteen years, the way we engineer software has revolutionized. It\u2019s spread Continuous Integration and delivery across the globe, humanized IT culture, automated toil, and paying down technical debt. But it\u2019s nowhere near done. A lot of organizations have hit the ceiling. A wall. The brakes. Stagnated. The promise remains: We can thrive in the digital age, create joy through customer experiences, move fast, be nimble, outcompete, and achieve extraordinary organizational performance. But it needs unlocking. #ValueStreamManagement has hundreds of years of history, but its time is now. Building on everything we\u2019ve learned from DevOps, using the toolchains, pipelines, and rich data sources we\u2019ve created, combining VSM and DevOps means we can see organizations as value-generating enterprises. We can pinpoint the choke points, bottlenecks, and dependencies and quickly apply fixes to optimize flow and value realization.\n\nIn this talk, Helen Beal will share real stories from enterprises she\u2019s worked with on how they\u2019ve relentlessly pursued improvement using VSM and DevOps practices and the outcomes they\u2019ve seen.\n\n----\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nHelen Beal is CEO and Chair of the Value Stream Management Consortium and co-chair of the OASIS Value Stream Management Interoperability Technical Committee. She leads the ambassador program at PeopleCert for the DevOps Institute, ITIL, and PRINCE2. She is also Chair of the DevNetwork DevOps Advisory Board and provides strategic advisory services to DevOps and VSM industry leaders.\n\nHelen authorizes the VSMC's annual State of VSM Reports and Moogsoft's State of Availability Report. She is also a co-author of Investments Unlimited, a book about DevOps and governance published by IT Revolution. She is a DevOps editor for InfoQ and writes for many other online platforms.\n\nHelen hosts the Day-to-Day DevOps webinar series for BrightTalk and speaks on DevOps, AI, and value stream-related topics at industry conferences and corporate events.\n\nShe regularly appears in TechBeacon\u2019s DevOps Top100 lists, was recognized as the Top DevOps Evangelist 2020 in the DevOps Dozen awards, and was a finalist for Computing DevOps Excellence Awards\u2019 DevOps Professional of the Year 2021.\n\nShe serves on advisory and judging boards for many initiatives, including Developer Week, DevOps World, JAX DevOps, and InterOp.\n\n----\n\n\ud83d\udc47 Learn more:\nhttps:\/\/www.thedevopsconference.com\/copenhagen?utm_campaign=The%20DevOps%20Conference%20Scandinavia%202024&utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social&utm_content=youtube_link_copenhagen_2024\n\nIf you want to learn more about DevOps transformations, check out our page here:\nhttps:\/\/www.eficode.com\/devops-transformation\n----\n00:00 Intro\n02:37 Where are we with DevOps?\n13:18 History of VSM\n17:56 What is VSM?\n24:49 Lead time and cycle time\n26:20 Guide to VSM\n28:30 Two dimensions of VSM\n29:51 The Value Cycle\n31:25 The DevOps Toolchain\n39:35 Outro",

        "videoDescription":"Eli's talk at DevOpsDays Raleigh focused on automating license checks in CI\/CD pipelines. Of course, the topic of open source licenses is fascinating to the All Things Open community and we wanted to learn more. During this interview, we talked with Eli about the importance of open source licensing, in particular, how they are automating license enforcement. Then we discussed some trends in DevOps from the perspective of a former DevOps engineer and manager.\n\nRegistration for All Things Open 2024 is now open. Register now to save your spot: https:\/\/allthingsopen.org\/ato-registration-now-open\n\n0:00 - Introduction\n0:08 - Welcome Eli Birger\n0:40 - Tell us about yourself\n2:10 - Can you share a few key takeaways that you shared with the audience here? \n3:28 - Why are open source licenses important?\n4:16 - What's happening in DevOps, a topic, a trend, a debate, that people should be aware of?\n5:09 - What's one piece of advice that you want to share with the All Things Open community?\n\nKey takeaways:\n* We publicly share  the CI\/CD enforcement we built for different types of licenses\n* The topic of open source licenses is very complex and very boring\n* The volume of licenses complicates the space\n* Be aware of \"blind spots\" in your processes and methodology\n* Do not take things for granted and challenge everything\n* Invest at least one hour a day for learning and challenging things\n\n###\nAbout Eli Birger \nEli is a passionate technologist with a background in telecom, cyber, and storage.

        "videoDescription":"This talk explains a balanced approach for a successful migration. A thorough understanding of the quirks of legacy applications is the foundation for a successful migration to more modern infrastructure in DevOps. However, this understanding cuts across various teams, not just the DevOps or SRE team. The security team has to perform a risk assessment, observability has to be in place by the SRE team, infrastructure compatibility, incremental migration strategy, Quality Assurance team needs to perform tests, and Documentation also has to be taken into account. Stakeholders - internal and external ones need to be carried along to manage expectations.\n\nThe approach of working across various teams ensures that all aspects of the migration process are addressed comprehensively, minimising risks and maximising the chances of success. Each team brings its expertise and perspective to the table, contributing to a well-rounded migration strategy. By involving all relevant teams and stakeholders from the outset, potential issues can be identified and addressed early on, leading to a smoother and more efficient migration process.",
