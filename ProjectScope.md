## Constraints
1. **Budget**: The project will utilize free tools and services to minimize costs.
2. **Time**: Each milestone must be completed within the defined time frame.
3. **Data Limitations**: The project is limited by the data available through the YouTube Data API.
4. **No Database**: Data storage and processing will occur directly through GitHub, with JSON files.
---
-->


## Assumptions
1. The YouTube Data API will provide accurate and up-to-date data for analysis.
2. The project is designed to be a self-contained analytics solution, not for public distribution.
3. No paid services or external funding are being used.

---

## Risks and Mitigation
1. **Quota Exhaustion**: The YouTube Data API might exceed its usage limits during development.
   - *Mitigation*: Use efficient queries and monitor API usage to avoid quota exhaustion.
2. **Data Integrity Issues**: Null values, duplicates, or inconsistent formatting could compromise data quality.
   - *Mitigation*: Implement robust data cleaning processes to ensure data accuracy.
3. **Streamlit Performance**: Large datasets could impact the performance of the Streamlit dashboard.
   - *Mitigation*: Optimize data handling, use pagination, and limit data loads where necessary.
